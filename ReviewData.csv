I worked at Presence Health full-time for more than a year
Pros
The cafeteria has good food and well priced.
Cons
Worst hospital I’ve worked in. The administration is very poor and the hospital system on doing things is extremely outdated. They still have physical charts follow the patients. Literally charts. Turn over for staff is always happening as evident by the old culture.
Advice to Management
Don’t hire my friends or family because I wouldn’t want them to work here.

- The seasoned Nurses are knowledgeable and helpful.
- The PCU Nurses are well-versed and dependable.
- The orientation process in the PCU is structured and provides you the needed background to ready oneself to be on their own.
Cons
- The ICU utilizes a lot of Agency Nurses, which affects the orientation process of new graduate nurses. The orientation process lacks structure and continuity to successfully prepare a new graduate to be on their own. The approach is to just ""throw you into it"" and have you figure it out.

- Structured staffing for Nurses and CNAs, not floating RNs and CNAs to other floors and causing other floors to be short-staffed and have Nurses end up with less-than-ideal patient ratios.

Cons
The merge created a lot of undue stress and a lot of things were not discussed prior. A lot of Janesville management and directors have bossy attitudes its their Janesville way or else. They don’t listen to work flow ideas from RMH partners they always take over and their ideas are always used. They need to know how to communicate with staff. Director will walk right past her staff and act as if they don’t exist....

How can you run a hospital when you're not here? Be visible to staff, hire the best candidate, not your Best Friend, go easy on the nepotism.

Horrible company. Benefits are atrocious. But the worst is management. They are too concerned with patting themselves on the back to care about what the employees actually think.

""Larger Hospital in Smaller Community""

No opinion of CEO
I worked at Blessing Health System for more than 5 years
Pros
Generally responsive and respectful physicians, smaller staff size lets you get to know people better. Parts of the building are being renovated, and will look nice when done.
Cons
Nurse to patient ratios are very high. There is a large amount of alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse among this very rural population, which leads to many readmissions and non-compliance among patients. The executive team shakes up the middle management on a very regular basis (every 2-3 years), which leads to constant change and confusion for staff and patients. Career employees are reshuffled for seemingly no good...

Don't worry so much about Magnet. Don't shake up the middle management so often. Don't worry so much about trying to expand into Hannibal. Concentrate on having a good hospital. Take care of and respect your employees and they'll take care of you.

No opinion of CEO
I have been working at Blessing Health System full-time
Pros
Pleasant patients, good supervision/management at unit level. Excellent teamwork among floor nurses and techs, and people will have your back if you're drowning. Solid benefits package. Room to advance if you're ambitious. Quincy has a low cost of living compared with large cities like St. Louis and Chicago.
Cons
Significant churn and turnover at both the top and bottom of the organization. High patient:staff ratios (while ideally 4-5:1 on acute care/med-surg floors, it's usually 5-7:1 in practice). Lower base pay compared with large cities, although this is offset by Quincy's low cost of living. Quincy may not be your cup of tea if you're a trendsetting urban socialite keen on trying out the latest and greatest Thai food.
Advice to Management
Continue adherence to ICARE values; they are solid principles. Make Magnet and other good-looking designations as longer-term reach goals rather than Priority 1. Priority 1 should be recruitment and retention of dedicated staff (both nursing and physicians), which will lower ratios and increase staff engagement/satisfaction. The longer-term goals will flow naturally from there.

I worked at Hospital Sisters Health System full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Sisters and the colleagues I worked with daily.
Cons
Management is horrible. Executives have a desire to be catered to 24/7. Unrealistic expectations. Tied to desk. Many days it was hard to just get time to go to the bathroom. No advocate for non-exempt employees when you have an issue to discuss. HR always sides w the manager, regardless of the issue, which is really not helping with HSHS growing a transparent work environment for colleagues.
Advice to Management
Quit firing people for getting sick, or who are older. We realize you can hire a younger person for less money, however this is not in line w the mission statement.

Management has been telling us many things but we keep getting more duties, less staff, and resources. We get many excuses and no answers for the actions or concerns we have with patient safety.

Listen to your employees concerns. Have a way to retain your seasoned staff. Don’t let money get into the way of patient care and safety. Cutting corners does not save money in the long run.

Trusting the The Human Resources department should be avoided.
Advice to Management
Would be helpful for new Hired Directors to be paired with a seasoned Director to learn the operations of the organization to learn all the expectation of all Hospital Directors. Or, HR could have an on boarding system for those in management to help with the learning curve of all the HR responsibilities placed on Directors who have direct reports.

Neutral Outlook
I have been working at University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
I found the diverse work force and patient population culturally stimulating, professional staff is dedicated to quality patient care and supports one another to this end.
Cons
Working within an organization as large as this can be frustrating at times as the capacity to make rapid change gets bogged down within the bureaucracy, e.g. hiring and replacing staff requires a long search and approval process

""Decent place to work but room for improvement""
Coordinator in Chicago, IL
I have been working at University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System
Pros
Benefits and vacation time are generous. For the most part management is flexible and allows you to work independently. If you are academic staff, they are flexible about your work schedule. There is a tuition waiver, and room for advancement. If you leave and decide to come back, managment tries to be accommodating. Most of the staff is friendly, open to going above and beyond the call of duty to help other...

Cons
Your salary increases are minimal. If you do have to use a time clock, there is very little flexibility in your schedule and you get reprimanded for clocking in early, late, and managers will usually not approve overtime pay.
Advice to Management
There seems to be a lack of motivation on the part of management to recruit the best, most qualified staff.

As a special ed teacher at GlenOaks, you work with kind, compassionate and experienced professionals as a member of a team that is looking out for what is best for each student and how to best support each other as staff members. The level of insight into the therapeutic educational process continues to impress me along with the commitment for ongoing education and improvement. Coworkers are more than coworkers,...

""GlenOaks Therapeutic Day School- STAY AWAY""
Current Employee - Teacher in Glendale Heights, IL

Neutral Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I have been working at AMITA Health full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
You will gain amazing experience working with mental health concerns. In no other job would you encounter such diversity in diagnosis.
Cons
Abusive administration that shames employees to cover up their bad practices. If you take a day off be prepared to get interrogated by administration. If you show up for work expect to do the job of at least 3 people because they have a very ineffective substitute system. Emotionally exhausting due to high student needs and manipulation from administration.
Advice to Management
Stop manipulating staff! When students assault staff (more often than you'd think), don't ignore it or try to blame the employee.

I have been working at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago full-time for more than a year
Pros
Great opportunity to gain valuable hands on healthcare experience with patients, doctors, and nurses. Some pretty exciting research initiatives taking place. A lot of promoting from within and lots of learning opportunities for CRCs within the hospital. Institution is growing rapidly, expanding research initiatives, and is dripping in donations. Inclusive culture of minorities and lgbtq+
Cons
The job is somewhat stressful and low paying. No opportunities to work from home. A high amount of turn over. Institution cares deeply about the nurses and doctors, but much less so for support staff. Position being asked to take on more and more responsibilities each year with no pay increase. (Caveat: each department is very different with some being better then others)
Advice to Management
Work to create a culture that makes CRCs feel important to the institution. More work functions and team bonding exercises. More opportunities to work from home, and some long over due pay increases.

Pros
Very little, except that they help

Cons
Benefit program isn’t great. Insurance is high and PTO is awful. Your PTO has to cover vacation, sick time or scheduled holidays when the office is closed.

If you want to be micromanaged, work on the corporate side, Legal in particular. Stressful work environment and there is a lack of fairness and poor management.
Advice to Management
Spending on unnecessary initiatives is rampant. Run the clinical side different then your corporate side and you may stop losing good employees. There are a multitude of manager and above levels, yet so many are inept at supervising others. Training in the areas of fairness, work/life balance and learning what it takes to be a good people manager is definitely needed.

1-Low pay compared to the market which is in the process of being adjusted so this should ameliorate

2- IT department will not pay for certifications in EPIC. They will allow you to gain proficiency which is self study + the project + the EPIC exam.

Lurie children's is a wonderful place to work. Being surrounded everyday by coworkers that are passionate and there for the right reasons is the best part.

Great atmosphere, nice work from home policy, competitive pay. The team I worked with was one of the best teams I've ever worked with. The IT departments are well respected among most leadership and physicians including many of the leaders at the top.

The health benefits were horrible. Super expensive out of pocket costs with horrible deductibles. Hard to maintain with a family, especially for a hospital. Most other hospitals in the area offer much better benefits. Most of your raise every year goes into the health premiums that also raise every year.

Seriously, the health benefits are one of the top reasons I personally left. I just could not justify paying that much money working in healthcare when I could easily go down the street to a competitor and have almost free healthcare for my whole family.

I worked at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago
Pros
I have only wonderful things to say about working at Lurie Children's Hospital. This is a place that is filled with compassionate and heartwarming employees. The #1 priority for all staff is the care of children and their families.
Cons
More of a warning than a con: This is a high stress job location. Be sure to be honest with yourself whether or not you can handle it and also, to know yourself well enough to recognize when you are starting to burn out.
Advice to Management
Within the department of International Patient Services, I have only glowing praise for the management. To create a new department with only two staff within the first year and turn it into a booming success, reaching hundreds of patients worldwide, is a testimony to the manager's skill and leadership.

""CMH Senior Administrative Assistant""
Senior Administrative Assistant in Chicago, IL
No opinion of CEO
I worked at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago
Pros
Patient care is #1 priority! CMH offers full-time employees $100 monthly for dependent child care and other small incentives like chair massages, summer BBQ, and holiday lunch. They also offer seminars for first time home buyers, investing for retirement and tips for saving for your child’s future college needs.
Cons
No pay increases, no 403b match, no bonuses, insurance deductible and out-of-pocket expenses has doubled. There’s no doubt that CMH offers exceptional care to its patients and their families – it would be nice if they extended that exceptional care to its employees as well.
Advice to Management
My advice seems pretty basic, but unfortunately it’s not practiced by most leadership – treat your employees the way you would like to be treated by your chief executive officer.

Many very nice individuals to work with, lovely community of patients.
Cons
No management support, pay and benefits consistently decreased, expected to provide the best service anywhere but at the same time expected to rush patients through like cattle. No time and without question not enough staff to provide safe, effective care.
Advice to Management
Stop focusing on particular initiatives that look great on the surface, but aren't supported. Ask staff...really sit and listen...and you'll find how discouraging this is. It comes across as purely empty talk, more feathers in the cap of titles and awards that make HR and senior management look good. Really start listening to your employees...deep down there is a disgust for your hypocrisy.

Differential lower than many other hospitals. Administrators make amazing salaries yet worker bees have seen too many salary freezes and low raises. Shame, shame on the big wigs when they have such a great working staff.
Advice to Management
Increase Rn differential! It should also increase when working a shift that goes from days to pms...this is the only hospital I know of that does 
this. Instead of freezing raises in the face of a hurting economy reduce your salary slightly to cover our cents on the dollar raises. Makes for
good moral!

Pros
Part of BJC now. You can transfer to another BJC facility. Some really great nurses work here! Critical access hospital. Has a nurse residency program.
Cons
Retirement is mostly self funded. 4% of salaries is contributed to a retirement fund managed by Vanguard you have to vest. Took away sick time and did not increase PTO as promised. Wages have improved but you can still get paid better by crossing the river. Management does not value employees. Very political environment. Its all about business now. Bad behavior is tolerated.
Advice to Management
Listen to staff. Manage patient ratios better. Deal with all the horizontal violence.

Clinical &amp; some non-clinical staff have no respect for self nor peers, no evidence of personal accountability. 
Short staff.

Former Employee - Anonymous Employee

Negative Outlook
No opinion of CEO
I worked at Memorial Network full-time
Pros
Residency program
Inservice education
$4500 per year for college nursing programs
Cons
Floors have cliques and the gossip mill is encouraged by management. Bullying is common.
Very short-staffed. Could be prevented by intelligent and pro-active management or better treatment of current managers.
Physicians often difficult to get in touch with or angry when contacted about patient condition.
Incentive pay not paid when charge RN, preceptor, bonus shift etc.
Advice to Management
Anticipate staff shortages and hire before staff leave.
Squash the rumor mill situation instead of encouraging infighting and lying.
Treat your employees with at least the amount of respect due a fellow human-being.
Bullying should not be tolerated.
Just because BJC does something one way does not mean it works best for Memorial.
Order supplies before they run out! This makes an unsafe environment.

-longevity of staff 
-supportive of continued education
-flexible, always making changes to follow EBP; maintain quality care.

Advice to Management
I feel in order to please customers we put to much of their care into their control... It shouldn't ever be that way. HCP should adhere to & enforce EBP POC/MD orders necessary to return the pt to, & maintain, optimal health while educating the patient on the importance of the plan of care, options there may be, and consequences to not doing so- which should include AMA. This can be done with professional competence...

Cons
Bad leadership, constantly changing procedures without regard to outcome
Advice to Management
Try be truthful! I don't think anyone really trusts management. Most of the hospitals moral is rock bottom! Walking on eggshells is not a good working environment. They have a habit of getting rid of people that have been there too long, getting too much vacation time and are at the top of the pay scale ( although that doesn't apply to Management).

They have let go of their entire OBGYN AND nurse midwife staff in spite of just finishing a major renovation to their OB floor AND started a robotics program.
Advice to Management
Figure out where true cost cutting makes sense. Wiping out a program like the midwives which were 1.5 Million in the black in real dollars was not a wise decision. Apparently firing the CFO was in order. What has happened is you have instilled a culture of uncertainty, no confidence and fear.

The only reason to work for MetroSouth is that you will meet some exceptional people. Their are many employees that are loyal, hard working individuals.

Management fails to think beyond their own little world and thus, neglects to communicate important information to employees. They also gossip and exchange information about their staff members with other employees in the department, or for that matter, with anyone.
Advice to Management

""Employees who feel ""Entitled"" to do what they want and the bosses who Enable them.""
MIS in Evergreen Park, Cook, IL
Doesn't Recommend
I have been working at Little Company of Mary Hospital & Health Care Centers
Pros
They let you come and go as you please, depending on where you work.
Understanding when family matters cause you to miss days.
Cons
As the title says, employees get away with all sorts of infractions that would be cause for a write up everywhere else.
ANCIENT infrastructure. The amount of infrastructure that is over ten years old in much more than was told to me in the interview. This is being addressed but...
Cheap. Company does not wish to pay for serious upgrades of some infrastructure, hampering the good upgrades they are doing.
Advice to Management
People need to be held responsible for their actions, not given a pass because they have been 10+ years.
Open up the wallet and pay for some better infrastructure. What you have now is unsupported unmanageable. Fixing one half but not fixing the other is a recipe for disaster.

""Ok place to work if you have a clinical degree.""
 in Evergreen Park, IL
Doesn't Recommend
I have been working at Little Company of Mary Hospital & Health Care Centers
Pros
They do, for the most part, really believe in the mission of the sisters. The hospital has a robust history, but unless they do something about employee behavior there will be no additional growth.
Cons
Poor management, staff are not held accountable for their actions...all talk, no action. 
Positions have been eliminated, and already stressed employees have been burdened with additional work.
Advice to Management
Seriously consider and hold ALL employees to your standards of behavior. Community members are not going to consider the hospital if they are treated poorly by the staff.

Cons
Ever since we went corporate and CHI took over, the quality hasn't been as good as before. In order to ""save money"" they cut employee wages and laid off a bunch of people, while at the same time spending money on new computer programs and other things that weren't a priority. More people are quitting than are being hired, and they are not advertising for any job openings, even though we so desperately need more...

Advice to Management
1. Do not cut employee wages just to ""cut costs."" There are other ways to do it that do not garnish the wages of those who are already struggling to make ends meet. We deserve every penny back that you took from us, if not more. 
2. Speed up the hiring process and post job advertisements. If you are going to drive employees away by cutting their wages, at least replace them in a timely fashion. It is unprofessional...

The staff are hardworking ethical nurses.

Management steamrolls staff, ""my way or the highway"". Do as I say, not as I do! Management has the evil eye to monitor the staff, but arrives late, takes long lunches and leaves early. Has cozy relationship with favorites but rules with iron fist to ""little people"" (staff).

Pros
Good people around that make the day go by better. Good relationships with surrounding departments. The good days make the cons forgettable or bearable.
Cons
Staffing levels are low, very likely you will work with very limited backup more often than I'd like to mention. Violent or combative patients are more common than they were in the past and Security is not well equipped/staffed to handle more than a few incidents at a time.

Pay is more than anywhere else in the region for my job title.
Cons
We are short providers so they are forcing us to use our PTO, float to another clinic but not get the pay incentive a float gets or take a day off with no pay. Recently informed this could be 1-3 days a week. Very disappointing.
Advice to Management
Allow senior employees the option of working in the clinic vs floating or being forced to use PTO or take a day off with no pay.

There were some rewarding moments that made the exhaustive hours of paperwork, and emotionally draining struggle to make a difference - worth it sometimes.

Some of the management was so focused on the business side of things they forgot why we were doing this work to begin with.

Cons
Nurse to patient ratios are very high. There is a large amount of alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse among this very rural population, which leads to many readmissions and non-compliance among patients. The executive team shakes up the middle management on a very regular basis (every 2-3 years), which leads to constant change and confusion for staff and patients. Career employees are reshuffled for seemingly no good...

""Blessing tries and usually delivers.""
Current Employee - Registered Nurse 
Recommends
Positive Outlook
No opinion of CEO
I have been working at Blessing Health System full-time
Pros
Pleasant patients, good supervision/management at unit level. Excellent teamwork among floor nurses and techs, and people will have your back if you're drowning. Solid benefits package. Room to advance if you're ambitious. Quincy has a low cost of living compared with large cities like St. Louis and Chicago.
Cons
Significant churn and turnover at both the top and bottom of the organization. High patient:staff ratios (while ideally 4-5:1 on acute care/med-surg floors, it's usually 5-7:1 in practice). Lower base pay compared with large cities, although this is offset by Quincy's low cost of living. Quincy may not be your cup of tea if you're a trendsetting urban socialite keen on trying out the latest and greatest Thai food.
Advice to Management
Continue adherence to ICARE values; they are solid principles. Make Magnet and other good-looking designations as longer-term reach goals rather than Priority 1. Priority 1 should be recruitment and retention of dedicated staff (both nursing and physicians), which will lower ratios and increase staff engagement/satisfaction. The longer-term goals will flow naturally from there.

You get a free membership to their Healthplex which is full of fitness classes and an abundance of exercise machines to choose from.

They penalize you for calling off sick which is pretty ridiculous considering this is a healthcare facility. You technically get zero sick time because they don't pay you when you call off. Paid time off needs to be scheduled.

Administration is standoffish and does not respond to employees concerns. No room for advancement beyond current job description if you are a nurse or clinical practitioner so those who obtain advanced degrees or further their education must seek employment elsewhere.

Certain staff members would continuously gossip about patients in a very loud and abrasive manner. Patients, no matter their background, should be treated with respect. I have witnessed sheets and pillows among other things being reused for different patients, DISGUSTING!!! There was very little support with staff and members. Doctors would join the nurses to gossip about patients. Many of the patients were labeled because of their immigrant status or just because they are on Medicaid and there for treated as if they have no value. It was very hard to witness. A very high stress environment for sure especially when there isn't a very strong support system. The neighborhood has transitioned and one might assume maybe the hospital has as well. You can paint a wall pretty but you can't fix the attitude in there with paint brushes.

Pros
I enjoy the family-like atmosphere in my department. Because of the ancient operating system, people in my field have to know a lot since we cannot rely on technology as much, therefore it has been a huge learning experience.
Cons
Lack. Of. Accountability. A significant amount of the physicians here (I won't say most but it's probably close to half) do not practice evidence based medicine consistently. They are not up to date with current guidelines, nor are they willing to learn. Furthermore, many of them come from a time when medicine was less collaborative and are not willing to work with other members of the healthcare team. They are rude, dismissive, and take no accountability when things go wrong with their patients. What's worse? Management caters to this. There is always a bit of this wherever you go, but at NAH it is rampant. Another con is the below market pay. For example, a person in my position at this institution gets payed $20-40k less per year than someone in the same position at another institution. This, compounded with the high stress environment and bad attitudes makes it hard to want to stay. Needless to say, there is a very high turnover rate.

These practices make sense for consulting, but not full time employees. Management says they are capitalizing the enhancement ticket hours, buts its really to reduce headcount. Who are you guys fooling? Multiple teams have had employees turnover. Constant restructuring at this organization. If you insist coming into the IT side of the business, know that every move of your is tracked via ServiceNow, promises are made for training and they don't follow through. You are pushed to close ServiceNow tickets even if the job is not done, so that management looks good. Management cares more about quantity vs. quality of work (as in closing tickets). Glad I left!

Pros
Good suburban location. Not part of a big healthcare conglomerate. Always adding services to boost revenue.
Cons
Any long term employees tend to hostile to new employees. Makes for uncomfortable and ineffective training periods. Dismissals are frequent for infractions rather than coaching or process improvement. It's almost as if middle management bonuses are based on how many employees they can terminate. When interacting with employees outside the laboratory either as an employee or a patient, most seem nervous and skittish. They have the behavior of people subjected to abuse. Ageism and racism in hiring and firing appear to be standard practice.

Pros
Most of the doctors are great, most of the other medical assistants are hard working stand up, honest people. The biggest pro of all is that I am no longer there.
Cons
I have never had so much anxiety working at a job, there is constant micromanaging going on and if you happen to do something a way the RN does not like (even if it is done and done correctly) she will yell and berate you in front of your fellow co workers and sometimes the doctors in a very humiliating and embarrassing way. They do not care about HIPAA, the office manager while sitting in her office will just yell out personal questions (about patients or even employees) to the RN sitting in the busy office, not to mention if you are in a surrounding exam room you can hear her through the walls. They do not care about the employees, it does not matter the situation the employee is in, there is no empathy/sympathy. The office manager in a meeting actually stated that employees with young children need to have someone else to take care of sick kids and if they can't then this is not the job for you. (So if you are a single mother stay away). I watched several co workers, good hard working people struggle with this issue. They will throw you right under the bus if it means them or one of the doctors will get into trouble. There is no job security, you are and definitely feel it, very expendable. Also the favoritism is off the charts, there are clear favorites in the office and everyone can see it. This is supposed to be a place that you can grow as an employee and further your career, if you are on the manager's good side they will give you the time off to go to school, if you are not in their good graces then they will tell you they cannot accommodate your school schedule. I have seen several very qualified people start and leave the job within a matter of weeks. Also if you managed to get on management's bad side they would clearly harass you and micromanage 10 x harder. To the point even the other employees and sometimes doctors would point it out. (Not to management of coarse, they've gotten to the point where they are feared).

I have been working at Northwest Community Hospital/Healthcare full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
What I love most about working at Northwest Community Hospital is the people that are dedicated to making it an exceptional and warm place to be. The team I work with is supportive, helpful, and knowledgeable. It is a friendly and warm environment that is dedicated to exceptional care of the patient and family. My manager and the scheduling department are flexible and understanding. It is a Magnet Status Hospital where nurses have autonomy and a voice. It is a great place to work and be.
Cons
Nurse to patient ratio is an ongoing challenging issue, especially as the acuity of the patients increases But I think this is an issue across the hospitals.

Pros
Loved working at NCH. I supported all surgical departments and loved the doctors.
Cons
I worked there for 11 years. In comes a new director and several in my department resigned. The director wanted her own people so wanted me out since I was the old team. She would make changes without telling me so she could fire me saying I was making mistakes. She wasn’t liked by the doctors and told us that if a doctor came in and started talking, we were to tell that doc that we needed to get back to work.

Since doctors became employees, or so it seems, my department is suffering. Big turnover in a department that we are not used too and difficulty finding new hires because of call requirement and the location you must live in because of call. I have not had a raise in 4 years! Maxed out! Get a lump sum thats added to your regular pay so taxes take most of that. On call and work crazy amount of hours. NOT WORTH IT! Management comes around and look like they feel sorry for you but they really don't. They are making the money and I can't even make plans for my off time because we are so busy likely to work late no matter what. It's all abut the MD's and their ""incentives"" not about the real employees

The hospital is really big and really nice. Has a lot of nice amenities that smaller hospitals don't, like a parking garage, plenty of access to food and drink ( including complimentary coffee) 24 hours/day from the cafeteria, and the salary is generous compared to other hospitals. The pharmacy is extremely busy so there was always opportunity for overtime which is great if you need it! It was a great learning experience also. Perfect job for those who want to learn and like to be challenged!
Cons
Extremely fast paced job...stay in shape because your body and feet will feel it! Can't really say anything too negative about it.

 I worked at Northwest Community Hospital/Healthcare
Pros
Hospital benefits are almost always better than anywhere else, and that was the case when I worked there. Pay was negotiable and I was able to attain a decent pay for the position I was in, which was Customer Service. The patient care was incredible from the little I saw, and focus is on patient satisfaction as it should be.
Cons
In orientation I was blown away by how good they said they were to their employees. Maybe it was true in other departments, but i found it to be completely untrue in the department where I worked. I can only speak in regards to the department where I worked. I was in a Customer Service department where it was the worst service I've ever seen. I couldn't understand how some of the employees even got their job because they were so unprofessional and rude to ""customers"". One of the worst managers I'd ever dealt with. Our department was the most unmanaged, disorganized departments I've ever worked in. I don't know if HR was totally clueless as to our situation, or if it was like that in other departments too, but it was bad. There was no sense of being a part of the organization, and important information was not relayed to our department.

In trouble if went over time. Scheduled work time not respected. No heads up if they need you to stay 30 min longer. If you leave at your regular time and leave doctor with pt in the room you may get in trouble. Happens all the time. Maybe not all locations. Depend on office manager.

Organization is very supportive to their employees. They recognize when census is high, stress levels high, new roll out of initiatives/computer systems etc and provide meal/snacks/gifts/accolades.

Many opportunies for advancement an education. I worked there 10 years and loved it.

Fast paced. Patient length of stay is a big focus, as it is in most hospitals in this healthcare climate, so patient acuity is high and patients admit and discharge quickly.

This place is the most toxic, unprofessional and amateurish organization I have ever had the misfortune of being hired at. This sentiment is echoed throughout many departments. When you discover someone else has also worked there, the connection of shared misery is quickly established. With all the RIFs of loyal lifers and 'walk outs' by smart newcomers, there is a buzz out there NCH is a place to be avoided at all costs. Countless employees lodge complaints, and ""investigations"" are conducted, but the same misguided bozos continue to sink the ship. Don't bother 'going to HR', with their wildly outdated processes and emotionally unstable leadership. Most of the nurses and support staff keep this place afloat, grin and bear it, and try to comfort the patients...but it needs to be taken over. When a medical staffer does something akin to negligence, they are 'written up' a few times, and nothing happens. I would not work here, nor would I receive care here. Consider yourself warned.

Pros
Most people are great to work with, culture was fabulous (but that's changing for the worse) and was the reason this small community hospital was so well regarded by everyone in the NW Chicago-Land area. Employees are super helpful to visitors. Nurses and allied professionals for the most part are awesome people and truly give of themselves.
Cons
HR hasn't updated job descriptions since 2000! Non-existent Fair Market Based pay structures. Some Part time employees report to THREE directors - can you say Overkill! Major staff reductions make for abrupt culture shock and very low morale

Pros
Very close group of employees that look out for each other. Benefits are decent. Education reimbursement is a nice plus, assuming they still offer it. Competitive pay.
Cons
It seems every week they bring in a new manager or vice president to make more foolish decisions that never seems to benefit the employees. Many departments are being outsourced thanks to the new management. Due to hiring freezes and layoffs, EVERY department is suffering with being short staffed which is causing a direct effect on employee morale. Employee morale had plummeted greatly over the past few years due to terrible new upper management.

I have been working at Northwest Community Hospital/Healthcare full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
I've worked here for 27 years; In today's economy everyone is sensitive to staffing shortages, pay freezes and cuts in benefits. We aren't immune to these but on the whole we are keeping pace or somewhat above other hospitals and businesses in trying to keep these cuts minimal. Most of the time I feel management is fairly transparent about information that is funneled down to the ""worker bees"". Unfortunately there's no perfect employer right now. NWCH has kept pace with salaries and benefits for comparable job titles which is a plus. Flexibility and care for it's employees has always helped me in tough times.
Cons
There's alot of negativity in general in health care and NWCH is no different. Many of the complaints revolve around problems and issues where staff wasn't consulted before changes have been made. Case in point - a remodel was done recently in my department and some designs were poorly planned because middle management didn't discuss the layout with the people that actually do the work! Not only a waste of money but this causes decreased morale and inefficiency.

they actually ""walk the talk"" by that i mean that upper management treats us like we are supposed to treat our patients. for example: when we had a bad snow storm a couple years ago, freezing cold. the CEO and HR Dir. were in the garage thanking people w/ a blockbuster gift card. then they walked thru the hospital doing the same thing. i came from a hospital which :said: ""Patients come first"" but actually their message was ""make it look like patients come first and closely control the $$"" not that my hospital hasn't had the typical downturn in this recent economy, we have. but spirits are high, vacancies are very low. and even when we had a freeze on raises they made it palatable.
Cons
no on-site child care, [nevertheless we were awarded 100 best places to work.] they are slow to make changes. we just got computer charting 2 yrs ago. and we are still not totally paperless yet. ex: computer Dr orders are still gradually being phased in. meals are rather expensive- except breakfast. we are going to consistent uniform colors [that can be good but also $$ in transition]

Pros
Good location, competent leadership, large employer in area, adequate benefits. An organization which has an interest in maintaining a good reputation in the community, (as all hospitals have), which helps ensure good treatment of employees. Good teamwork in many patient care departments. A commitment by the organization to make healthcare accessible to the entire local community--offsite treatment centers, access centers for patients with limited/no insurance are available. Large, experienced medical staff with good reputations. Wide variety of specialized care available...in heart treatment, GI treatment in particular. NCH has received, and earned, many awards from organizations which evaluate the quality of hospitals and other healthcare organizations. Ambitious physical expansion of the hospital and offsite facilities in progress in an attempt to keep NCH competitive in the area.
Cons
For many years now, construction on the main campus has been a serious disadvantage to patients and staff. Some staff, and some patients, feel that the hospital's expansion has been too ambitious, leading to unnecessary disruption in patient flow and treatment, staffing, staff reimbursement and benefits...may be too ambitious an expansion commitment in the present financial environment. Benefits to staff recently cut, at very short notice, and to the serious disadvantage of staff at lower pay levels. Only explanation offered was that these cuts were 'in line with local hospital's benefit levels'...but it is always difficult to adjust to lower reimbursement abruptly.

There is a family type atmosphere among employees and respect for each other. Longevity of employees is common. We have great benefits too compared to other hospitals in the area
Cons
Has tendency to promote from within which can be a great opportunity for most but at other times not always the best qualified gets the jobs and fresh ideas are sometimes needed to shed new light on old processes. It is hard to get some things done in a reasonable amount of time for example, when computers break down, it seems like it takes forever to get service and when you try to explain the reason for the urgency, the department doesn't necessarily understand why your problem is of urgency. There also are way too many meetings and some of them overlap

Pros
The dining room was nice and all the peoples working there are nice. I walked when on breaks and the suroundings are very cam outside. It helped me to be cam when i go back to work.
Cons
The people in charge of the HIM work us very hard. We had to scan many pages into computers. We had to finish days work and if we did not we had to punch out and finish the work. if we got sick for a day or 2 we had to make up the work by saturday. This was very hard to do and you worked with being sick so you did not give up evening or saturday. Some nice lady saw this was wrong. She is from united states so she knows the working laws. She talks to people in HR and all of it stoped. but the bosses did not get in trouble . HR did not pay for the extra work we did. Everyone says thats ok becus they do not want to be fired and many are from other countries . But everyone really wants the pay. I do not work here any more. Thank you to my frend. She helps me write this. Friend here! I cleaned up the spelling some what but I didn't want the statements to lose my friend's ""voice."" I hope this passes your review process.

It was a delight to spend a year there and I fully enjoyed it.

The location is not the best. I lived in a university apartment one block and occasionally could hear gun shots.

Go back to the drawing board and start created an institution that is not only at the ""Forefront of medicine"" but at the ""Forefront of business"". Don't continue to spend money on things like changing the name from University of Chicago Hospital to Medical Center and now Medicine. Whoever proposed that and approved it should be fired immediately. 

Strive to de-unionize the workforce. Pay people a fare wage/salary....

""Poor leadership, no consideration for employees""
Medical Technologist in Chicago, IL
Doesn't Recommend
Disapproves of CEO
I have been working at University of Chicago Hospital
Pros
This is a prestigious institution to work for. It has decent benefits, a very nice campus, and lots of research opportunities. 
The Oncology department has a very good national standing.
Cons
Employees are overworked, overstressed and underpaid. No career advancement opportunities. Rampant bureaucracy. Pervasive Politics in the institution. No recognition for any employee below management. Senior management is perceived as a menace. Management does not communicate with employees.
Advice to Management
Management should improve communication with staff. Reward employees with better wages, showing more appreciation, and investing more in your employees. Managers should also stand up for their employees and make them feel like they have someone on their side.

""Prestigious medical center + highly critical, manage-by-fear leadership = low morale, high turnover""
 in Chicago, IL
No opinion of CEO
I have been working at University of Chicago Hospital
Pros
Prestigious medical center, highly qualified medical staff. Some staff are really good at what they do, but it's a mixed bag.
Cons
UChicago is a very elitist place, and meetings often turn into snark fests where people bicker over who's right/smarter rather than working for the organization. Employees are very fearful of misstepping bounds. The halls should be paved with eggshells.
Advice to Management
Trust your employees. Be kind. Be fair. Do something about the negative atmosphere. It's just not ok to allow senior leaders and doctors to behave badly.

Start focusing more on the satisfication of your employees as well as allowing the opportunity for growth when employees such as support service personnel further their education or advance their skills and is not promoted in a position for those newly acquired skills.

Pros
University of Chicago campus is lovely place. Scientific collaborations are easy to establish, and the research staff is young and motivated. The instrumentation is decent and one could perform whatever project he/she would like.
Cons
The Hydepark neighborhood, where the university is located is crime stricken; it is common to hear about an armed robbery that happened the previous evening just around the corner. As a student there are plenty of activities and networking going on in the department, however when you are a postdoc, you are doomed to a life of isolation.

Registered Nurse in Alton, IL

I worked at Alton Memorial Hospital
Pros
The staff there is very knowledgeable and there are many years of experience between all the nursing staff there. I would trust them to care for my loved ones-- they give good care with the staffing ratios they have. If my family were sick I would definitely take them there. Also, the employed physicians are very good, respectable and are easy to approach.
Cons
The staffing ratios were not good and we rarely had enough assistant help. The social climate there is much like a high school-- even if you don't want to become involved you sort of get pulled in. If you're not part of the 'clique' you often get left out or talked about. Also, needs enough functioning equipment.
Advice to Management
Get more Patient Care Techs and more equipment that functions properly (bp machines/dynamaps). Retain your good staff.

Staffing ratios are horrible. PCU nurses can have up to 10 patients. ICU nurses take 3 and sometimes 4 high-acuity patients. Nurse leaders are furloughed at the end of each year so they are afraid to take their PTO for real vacations. The administrative culture is hostile and toxic.

They have a ways to go with the operations of the company. So many fixable issues that go on and on and the load falls on everyone (especially nurses).

In addition, it is unhealthy for the staff..save the patient but kill the employee....

Advice to Management
Hire a business person for operations. You shouldn't have to walk a mile to get a medication from the opposite side of the building, In addition, if you had correct staffing 90% of the time you wouldn't continue to have turnover. Be more creative; allow people to come in 4 hours or 8 hours..it's better than being understaffed. Part timers that may not need the benefits...why not?
Have people be on call once a month...

Pros
There were not many beneficial things from working at Vista. If you are with the in crowd things seems to go very well. Once you are shun from the crowd you Vista experience will be bad. There is opportunity for growth because of the constant turn over in leadership.
Cons
You need to watch your back. There is a culture of stab your coworkers in the back and report back to the CEO for your treat. The environment is filled with miss trust from the many of the key stakeholders.

The benefits are good. Employees get virtually free health at Vista facilities since most out of pocket balances are waived.
Cons
Extremely unstable work environment. Constant turnover in management at all levels. Turnover throughout the hospital is alarmingly high. This hospital simply cannot keep good employees. Even still, employee morale and retention was never made a priority. The hospital is run by management who are just there temporarily until they can find something better elsewhere, and as a result there is very little engagement in...

""Enjoyed the work but not the gossiping, backstabbing and brown nosing. Managers should remain neutral and professional""
 I worked at Vista Health System
Pros
I enjoyed the work and learning new things. The wages were also good for the area.
Cons
The manager was too busy running outside on smoke breaks with the gossiping, ladder climbing people which also involved her being actively involved in their personal lives and activities outside of work to the extent of playing into their hands. At work they also did a lot of little things on a personal level (not work related) in their efforts to vy for perks and opportunities from her.
Advice to Management
This is a business that could do better financially as well as in other facets of the business (such as hiring and keeping productive and valuable employees) if you'd oversee management better. I personally saw wheras the company could have bettered itself financially but didn't do it.

Regarding compensation, the pay was great.
Cons
Case Management Management was out of touch with their team and operated from an extremely pejorative and punitive framework; there was no empowerment. Extremely unrealistic with the ask of their team and no where to be found when support was needed.
Advice to Management
The best way with garner respect and emulate integrity is to roll up your sleeves and pitch in. You don't ask of your team what you aren't willing to do yourself...that is true leadership.

Pros
The hospital seems to really care about the community, the patients, and the employees. Lots of educational events and opportunities for tuition assistance. Great employees - smart, motivated, caring.
Cons
PTO is TERRIBLE - we get half the days off that people at other places get - I'm considering going elsewhere just because of this. Every department is constantly understaffed because people get burnt out and leave and then those remaining have to scramble to cover, and then the process repeats itself.
Advice to Management
Stop being so stingy with holiday/vacation/sick/PTO time! It's insulting and goes against your claims of caring about ""wellness"". You hire excellent people and they go above and beyond. They deserve a break and everyone is soooo burnt out. You'll save money on hiring and training if you keep people here, and you're losing people because they are exhausted.

Micromanagement is everything about the diagnostic imaging departments. No ability to work alone without constantly being yelled at by management. No ability to talk to management without being scared to get yelled out. No help from management when problems arise. It’s always the techs fault for everything. Only one person off for PTO a day.
Advice to Management
Try hearing what your employees have to say about workload. Overworking your employees and making them feel like they aren’t important makes them not want to work there anymore. This can be shown by the number of techs leaving. No one wants to be micromanaged!!

Rush medical has a great network of doctors and average compensation model for non-clinical employees. Ability to move internally is a pro for those looking for lateral and vertical career changes.

Faculty Recruitment has one of the highest turnovers for departments. In the time I was there 6 of my colleagues termed (department of 9).

It's nearly impossible to grow under this environment.

It is difficult to find direction when the Director/VP is seemingly handling two roles. The managers could use some training to help better the communication they give, if any. Most problems in this department could be resolved in looking top down. I recommend...

Management is terrible and they have no idea what they are doing, they never consult employees before starting poorly planned new initiatives. Then when the initiatives don't work out (which they usually don't) management is quick to put the...

Only thing I might suggest- for the employees who have no patient contact and work at a computer all day, allow these people to work remotely. It will solve a lot of your parking problems, and most of us on salary put in a pretty grueling day. Eliminating 2-3 hours in traffic every day would be a great perk, and help with employee retention, work/life balance . Also, hire remote to be able to find the talent needed...

Pay attention to the employees in the lower level of your organization. Our department seem to be one of the unhappiest in the workplace

Human Resources- what the heck is up with that? Can hardly ever speak to a person-- ever. Policies are buried. PTO sucks so badly. I wish I knew that coming in. You don't have a 'bank' of PTO, you accrue it. So, if you've already planned vacations and start working there, you only earn 5 hours off every 2 weeks for the first 3 months. If you get sick, you're SOL because that comes out of PTO too. Holidays come out...

Cons
This is the most political place I have ever worked. It's beyond frustrating and often presents roadblocks that prevent adequate work with patients.

PTO is awful. As a full time non-manager you only get a couple of weeks a year and half are required holidays. If you have kids, most of the days you take off have to be unpaid since you run out of PTO.

Limited upward mobility.

Stop the politics. Take care of your own employees. Listen to what they need. Lower social work caseloads.

I think the Rush should seriously consider if listing this job under Rush Medical Center is in appropriate and deceptive.

""Registered Nurse""
Registered Nurse in Chicago, IL
I worked at Rush University Medical Center for more than a year
Pros
Great opportunities to further education. I loved my co-workers -- medical assistants, front staff, pediatricians were all amazing. Made you feel supported throughout your work day.
Cons
They take PTO hours away for holidays... Managers have just fallen into management 
positions without the qualifications. This has been disruptive with scheduling and being fair.
Advice to Management
Proper staffing. Find a clear cut scope of practice for medical assistants. Consistency with inforcing policies.

Pros
Pretty good salary 
Work from home availability (depends on department)
Cons
If you're not a doctor or a VP, you're nobody. The top-down decision making is infuriating. It's like Dilbert come to life. Some executives are downright toxic and destructive (here's looking at you, HR) but nothing is done about it. That makes it look like Rush leadership is either clueless or cares more about protecting their own than running the place well.
Advice to Management
STOP with the lip service and the endless engagement surveys. You're just ticking people off. Get a grip on your culture. Acknowledge that Rush is an elitest, hierarchical organization and that YOU benefit from this at the expense of your employees. Own it and tell employees to accept it, or change it. But don't keep pretending it's not that way.

Uncompetitive pay compared to other hospitals in the area, the Human Resources department is extremely unhelpful with extremely outdated policies and procedures. Opportunities to move up in pay and position are few and limited. Salary methodology is super secretive and illogical.
Advice to Management
Reward the individuals who are attempting to work their way up from the bottom. Offer competitive pay and evaluate each individual's compensation on a case-by-case situation instead of establishing a generic max increase of 10% for internal transfers. Rush is a great place to work, but its greatness is hindered by its inability to fairly compensate.

I worked at Rush University Medical Center full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Excellent location, convenient to many modes of transportation. Lots of new and exciting campus development activities. Great physicians, researchers and staff.
Cons
Overall great place to work if you are not looking to advance your career or looking for an environment that supports global transparency; many of the policies & procedures are undocumented, outdated or just plain kept out of reach of the employees. Salary information is top secret thus preventing employees from effectively evaluating any potential change in career direction.
Advice to Management
The sharing of information is vital to building a team of world-class employees. Eliminate the secrecy about business policies and hiring practices. Show your employees that they matter as you work together to become the top healthcare provider in the city.

Little onboarding, so it's very sink or swim. Lack of work culture. Political and hierarchical. The PIs unsurprisingly have big egos.

Very good health benefits. In terms of promotions very difficult. But personal growth and work environment is good.

Vacation and sick leave system is worst I have seen. You get your PTO deducted for national holidays too which I have never heard of. Hard to get raise and depends on your boss. No bonus.

They threaten to close programs and eliminate jobs here so frequently, it is hard to feel loyal or secure. The programs and departments are all pretty separate which often complicates procedures and policies. Campus wide, the position titles and grades should be more consistent.
Advice to Management
Those at the highest levels of management do not seem very interested in the rest of us. (Although this is slightly better than it was a few years ago.) Please try to be more engaged. As much as career development is valued at Rush, career advancement within the institution is hard to accomplish. We lose a whole lot of really good people because of that.

Work on really improving customer service and talk to employees who really care about how to do so. Allow more growth for employees who have taken the time to actually go back to school in order to become more of an asset to the company.

Good salary, went to grad school for free. Good professional culture, people are expected to behave professionally and when they don't it is addressed. I never had a problem getting equipment to take care of my patient's and staffing is appropirate. This is the best place that I have ever worked.
Cons
Compared to a community hospital nurses don't have as much automnomy because the residents and interns do a lot of the work. This is nice sometimes because it is less responsibility but you have to page an MD for simple orders a lot, like ptt for heparin drip.
Advice to Management
Keep up the good work, RUSH is a great place to work in my opinion.

Advice to Management
You have the demonstrated capacity to communicate effectively--but you need to deploy it consistently. I was very idealistic about Dr. Goodman, but became very disillusioned

Open positions for advancement are not often available. Almost feel like you have to leave and come back when a position finally opens.

Pros
Quality patient care (from my perspective as an administrator and also as a patient!), smart senior management, good location, decent benefits (but far less generous today than they were for people hired in the 90s), and child care.
Cons
The Rush of today is still recovering from the mistakes and mindset of its previous administration, which had no business strategy, did zero marketing, and was just plain arrogant. You can't change everything overnight, although the management is certainly trying to do its best, but things could/should move faster. Thank goodness they are finally updating those awful buildings - they can't compete with other...

There are definitely growth opportunities within the company for employees wanting to grow professionally and educationally.
Cons
As a fairly new nurse practitioner I noticed that Walgreens APNs are offered starting hourly rate $10 more than hospital-based or outpatient clinic AMG APNs. Salary for middle level providers it’s not competitive. Although it’s advertised differently. Personally I think that advocate pays more Walgreens APN due to union status and hospitals APN do not get that benefit.

""Could be better, could be worse""

Neutral Outlook
I have been working at Palos Community Hospital full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
You'll get better pay than at most places. From what I understand we are paid higher than just about anywhere. You'll still be broke though....
Cons
You can sucked in and end up putting up with a lot more than you bargained for. Yes they pay more but you'll start to wonder if it's really worth it. Cna's are definitely looked down on.
Advice to Management
Better treatment towards CNA's. Granted we have a great new boss, overall the CNA's are looked down upon from all staff.

Good Pay, good benefits, work around your schedule, and a friendly environment. It really depends on the department you work for. I've been working there for one year, and as a college student I am very satisfied working at palos for now. There is always room to grow and move up. Excellent benefits!
Cons
It is sometimes not very possible to get raises with the current budget cuts. Palos is known to start at a high pay wage, however, this is not the case right now with a tighter budget, it is less likely to make more money.

Employees have no input, are not recognized for the experience and knowledge. Lots of favortism. Lots of putting blame on others except the ones that are truy responsible.

The hospital has a good opportunity for growth but admin needs to stop repeating its same mistakes over and over. Stop and look at the patterns, listen to your employees, stop being so stubborn and make the changes that need to be done to make your employees happy! Then you'll retain them and stop this viscous cycle of employee turnover.

As a flex you can work as much overtime as you want. Fulltime staff are given raises. Flex need to work a minimum of 32hrs a month (no weekends)

Management does not care about their staff. All they care about are numbers for hcaps. If staff has a complaint and it is addressed, nothing is done about it. Patient care is drastically declining because of the staff being overworked and management not hiring to compensate the ratio's

Many opportunities for growth outside of patient care. Clinical ladder allows for promotion while maintaining clinical duties. There is a significant amount of professional autonomy. No quotas for charges.
Cons
It's a physician based organization. Sometimes difficult to push through new initiatives that are not backed by physicians. The equipment in the clinic is not always the latest or state of the art. Large organization so it is a longer process to get new equipment.
Advice to Management
Communication is key. Setting clear organizational goals and being explicit on how individual employees can work toward those goals in day to day work.

Many opportunities for growth outside of patient care. Clinical ladder allows for promotion while maintaining clinical duties. There is a significant amount of professional autonomy. No quotas for charges.

It's a physician based organization. Sometimes difficult to push through new initiatives that are not backed by physicians. The equipment in the clinic is not always the latest or state of the art. Large organization so it is a longer process to get new equipment.

Cons are typical of any healthcare system today - poor staff-to-patient ratios and too much focus on turning profits in exchange for subpar healthcare practices.

I worked at Presence Health for more than 5 years
Pros
There are still plenty of people there who genuinely care for others. They put up with the changes and lower compensation because their patients matter to them.
Cons
Employees are so burnt out - they always seem negative and like they're defending themselves. Management used to be able to run their own department but now they're just puppets.
Advice to Management
I understand you've got to run a business, but decisions need to be made for the long-run and not just to create busywork and put a feather in your cap.

Pros
It is a smaller community hospital so you will have the ability to ask a lot of questions and perhaps learn about more things than you would at a larger hospital. The staff all know each other very well and it is a close knit family environment.
Cons
The hospital is poorly managed and the culture of the employees is to do the least amount of work as possible and get paid for it. The supervisors and managers generally have no care for what happens in their departments until there is a health inspection or government inspection coming. Suddenly they are all present and active in ""being a manager.""
Advice to Management
Start from the top and employ people and a culture that will encourage and reward people for doing their jobs, doing them well, and being responsible for what they are supposed to be doing. Don't decide that you magically want to start helping more or being more involved in the department when there is a health inspection coming in.

Good pathology, cushy pension plan for those who qualify, wide diversity of patients, salary pretty good when compared to academic institutions, if you like calling in sick, this is the hospital to work for....staff like to call in sick particularly nurses, and on monday, fridays, near holidays.
Cons
administration constantly raising amount of clinical responsibilities so this leaves very little time for other academic pursuits. Retirement plans are dismal if you're not part of the old pension plan, poor leadership with a vision that makes sense but with no plan- it's pretty much do without planning it through and with little communication to staff about changes, very poor morale overall among the physicians...

Staff is expected to live to work, not work to live. Only still around because of incredible coworkers. Salary increases are the same across the board regardless of how much effort you put in.

You will be lied to by management while interviewing and through hiring process.

Reexamine the employee medical benefits. Hold employees accountable for their call offs-multiple call offs every month because an employee has PTO to use is not fair.

I've come across some things that I have noticed that could work better in my clinic and with Advocate generally speaking. Better communication with clinical staff and nurses. Making sure that every one is on the same page with patients. PSRs need to communicate with the clinical staff when it comes to checking insurances and making sure insurance is correct and active.

Pay your interns! They have value and you ask a lot of them. They will be more likely to give you their best if you're at least paying them a stipend.

""Management Issues""
Current Employee - Pediatrician in Chicago, IL
I have been working at Advocate Aurora Health full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Other Doctors are great to work with
Cons
Support staff constantly feels threatened by doctors and often downplays their advice by advocating their experience. They also negatively rate doctors. The doctors cannot rate the support staff. There is no two way communication.

Cons
Nurse to patient ratios are not great. 5:1, 6:1 night shift with no techs overnight to help staff and pay is slightly lower than other Chicago hospitals
Advice to Management
Create better nurse to patient ratios and allow techs to work night shifts to help with patient load and tasks. Biggest reason why people leave the floors is because we are overworked and burned out from not having enough support on the floors

Below industry wages in radiology. This is why technologists leave. Techs at Northwestern earn well below competitive industry standards. Embarrassing that they treat dedicated hard workers this way when they could be compensated more fairly. Nurses just had a wage adjustment, why not radiology?

Pay us a fair wage. Be more flexible with schedules to account for your workers family. On site day care may help your workers with children.

When I was hired the manager wouldnt train me. He had other employees train me. After which he criticizes my work when i feel like my work is comparable to orhers.

Train your employees. Dont criticize after you have other enployees train them. Employees need to know how ro do the job right before you criticize. Try and have a more welcoming environment for employees. Make them feel part of the team.

You get paid hourly just like everyone else...

Downsides? Like everyday unless you are one of the higher ups. Employees get treated like children, security sits on and abuses their patients and sometimes ""snooze"" on dangerous patients. And when they aren't watching someone dangerous, they are babysitting a child instead. Everyone has a fake crappy attitude! Doctors, nurses, care techs, security, everyone!

Hire people who actually like helping people and not treat them as if they aren't important to the hospital. That would prevent negligence and save lives!

Pros
Wow...we are Northwestern now. Thanks for nothing. Northwestern is over rated. The health benefits are supposed to be something fantastic when in reality there comparable to a lot of other big named companies.
Cons
Pcts are underpaid, worked to the bone and usually understaffed. Night techs are taking anywhere from 13 to 26 patients and it's not safe patient care and this is unacceptable use of staff. Very few good nurses who will help. Teamwork is hard to come by sometime expect to be on your feet for almost the full 12 hours. 
Patients expect to be waited on hand and foot like it's some kind of hotel. I would never consider...

Listen to feedback and patient safety events from your techs. Use follow up questions and investigate nursing staff appropriately. Give credit where credit is due, we work hard! This unit is going to loose valued staff because of the lack of organization and follow through.

Nurses are highly valued and supported and have achieved magnet status for it. Continuing education is highly valued and recognized. Many nurses seek out further certifications, degrees, and are apart of many organizations to stay involved.

Great as a second or part time job; evening hours available. Benefits are pretty decent compared to other jobs in this pay bracket.

Cons
Difficult to get a full 40hr week, and the pay rate is much lower than others in the industry. There are a number of bonuses that are considered ""benefits"", however they are based on the finances of the lab as a whole, so even if you work your butt off there is no guarantee you'll receive anything. Many never do, and the amount of the bonus is not enough to offset the low pay rate. There is little communication...

""OK Atmosphere, Short Hours""
Staff Accountant in Winfield, IL
Disapproves of CEO
I worked at Central DuPage Hospital
Pros
Friendly staff, the hours were more than fair and reasonable. A lot of Fridays I could go home by 3:00PM.
Cons
Some of the days could drag on while others could be consumed with pressing requests from upper management. A lot of stress during those times.
Advice to Management
Care more about your employees in fiscal services area. We are the people who make the Hospital run efficiently and maximize revenues.

I have been working at Central DuPage Hospital
Pros
Great hospital, Great coworkers, Good benefits. Good job, Very nice hospital! You have the ability to work with patients and families that really geniuine care and appreciate your help which makes me feel really really good. The hospital is so well kept and cleaned it dosen't even feel like a hospital it feels like a hotel!
Cons
Management sucks! Don't pay enough! I can bust my butt and don't my job everyday perfectly, come in on time and never call off but never recieve any recongnition fro anything good. I have had a incident which my boss has actually lied to me or about me to cover his behind so that he wouldn't get in trouble. I highly disliked the incident.
Advice to Management
More communication with workers, Support workers, Give complements when due. Show appreciation! When you see you employees in the hall have the decency to say hi!

Former Employee - Anonymous Employee in Red Bud, IL

Neutral Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I worked at Red Bud Regional Hospital full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Reasonable starting salary for the area
Cons
Overall very low morale. Not surprising given some of the management and when that is combined with the furloughs. Rather than give raises that are more than a tenth of inflation, they rate their employees low and blame the laughably low raise on the employee’s performance. That has been ongoing for decades.
Advice to Management
If you can’t afford to give raises, say that. Accurate reviews can be very informative. And for Pete’s sake TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES. Please. Share your coveted information. And talk to your employees as if they have value. It makes a difference.

Cons

continued loss of employees is inevitable if you don't take the time to evaluate the ideas employees bring up for review.

Pros
Met some great employees, but they all leave within months of hire.
Cons
Understaffed and extremely rude patients. There is a reason this hospital always has openings for nurses and that's because they all leave after working here for a year or less. Management does not listen to their staff. Policies and procedures are a joke. Nobody seems to know them and they are out of date.
Advice to Management
Listen to your staff!! Happy staff means happy patients. How can you expect to have great satisfaction scores if your staff is unhappy. Look at you turnover rates.. they're like a revolving door. Before you work on getting magnet status, which you never wil, focus on making this a positive place to work first.

Mission based; Trinity Health (system that owns) seems OK. Average pay. Easy to get to. Most employees are very friendly. Clean for the most part.

New CEO is HORRIBLE. Doesn't care about staff or patients. Employees are laid off and they try to hide it. Money for new lobbies, new executive suites, new executive salaries. None for what matters -- patient's care. It is clear it's her way or the highway, without cause. If she doesn't like you, you're gone. So many people just disappear.

Coworkers treat each like family. Great morale. Maintains close-knit culture at all network locations.

Low pay. Most workers that are above entry level have either been there for 10+ years or have a family member working there so not much opportunity for advancement. Lots of women so environment can get petty and catty at times. Old and inefficient processes - which they are working on.
Advice to Management
Continue to invest in updating systems and processes and bring KSB into the new century! Also, invest in your people by providing and creating opportunities that are above entry level work for your more experienced or skilled workers. Standardize your processes - every office and clinic and department does the basic things a different way, a KSB standard should be uniform across all locations. And don't forget...

Pros
Still have veteran hard-working food service people. The new CEO has gotten some of our equipment fixed, a lot actually. ( The old CEO is gone, thank God and Greyhound).
Cons
Still top-heavy in management. Recently instituted cuts in some staff hours, not sure whose idea. Food service management insists on paperwork, paperwork, paperwork; again, this maybe the PHCs(pointy haired corporates) idea. My paperwork filling out time rivals the time I actually spend on my job.
Advice to Management
Respect the employees. Keep the equipment fixed, especially now that you have a handle on things. You'll get more work out of your people if they can spend less time writing down numbers. And streamline your annual benefits enrollment so your people don't have to go berserk getting the computer to accept their password!

At the time I worked there, they where VERY short handed and nurses were taking on too many patients at a time. The veteran nurses as mentioned above where too busy to share their experiences with new nurses. The locked pediatric unit was just a storage area. It should have been opened and kids should have been taken care of in there.

Many people from upper management to HR are not qualified to do the job.. They will fake it to u make it motto. HR doesn’t care and will not take your concerns anywhere..

If you're PRN employee the hourly wage is better than working at many other places. Unfortunately, the pay never increases for prn staff no matter how long you've been there or if you get good job performance ratings. The majority of workers try to come together as a team.
Cons
The insurance is not great. Even getting procedures done at their own hospital sites is very expensive. Of course part time workers don't get the incentives full time employees get including insurance, sick days, vacation, or holiday pay. The units are almost always a mess, meaning they are unorganized, missing needed materials to do the job well, mismanaged, in need of updating. This makes the job so stressful....

Walk the walk of each job title on the unit you supervise. If you know from actual experience where the problems lie, you'll be better able to remedy them as well as empathize with the staff for the things you have no control over changing. The best supervisors could fill any position if necessary.

""Great pay!""
Nurse Practitioner in Granite City, IL
I have been working at Gateway Regional Medical Center
Pros
Excellent pay.
Excellent time off.
Very kind co-workers and middle management.
Fair benefits, though you had to use the hospital for health insurance in an inner-city.
Cons
Poor organization of management. Individual offices with little to no supervision, very laissez faire. Problem providers and employees were kept because of the political/financial burder of removing them. 
Poor operations management--buying was disorganized and inefficient. Central supply would be a much better solution to supply offices with supplies. As it was product constantly expired before it was used. There...

Advice to Management
They need experienced management, not simply a variety of young men at their first executive position making an attempt up the ladder. Move the hospital out of the inner city or at least build an additional. You will never compete as a big provider in that location. Most people are not going to seek care at a facility with that location.

No training for new nurses. You don't get a preceptor. They just throw you into the deep end and you sink or swim.

Management needs to treat criticism as opportunities for improvement instead of personal attacks on their department or encroachment by another department.

Horrible management. Completely unorganized, managerial staff has little respect for the people under them, and requesting PTO is a nightmare. It's sad when you see new hires for positions that after a week quit their job. The medical assistant position was a revolving door. As for the office position the protocols would change weekly, write ups for the smallest thing, and morale was always at low.
Advice to Management
At business school we were taught when employees keep quitting and leaving the company, something is wrong with the managerial staff. I'm surprise no one has taken responsibility for the constant pattern of people quitting. It's obviously expensive to keep training new staff and it seems the managers were given a pass.

It is hard to maintain a work life balance because vacations are not always approved and the schedule does not come out in a timely matter. It is also difficult to switch from night shift to day shift: I have been on the wait list to switch to days for almost 8 months and it is not looking like that will change anytime soon.

Good people are leaving. Resurvey your nurses and listen. Do not tolerate unprideful behavior from any level. Just because someone makes money for the organization or is favored by physicians should not be a free ticket to allow bad behavior. Don't be blissfully blind.

Pros
Centralia, il campus is small, employees are friendly. Some units are modernized.
Cons
SSM corporation took over, no longer cares about employees or patients. Only concern is money. All money is put into the new hospital in Mt. Vernon, IL, Centralia hospital is neglected. Poor nurse to patient ratio, trying to save money.
Advice to Management
Promote both hospitals equally. Be more concerned with staff to patient ratios.

Pros
Close to home if you live in the area
Cons
Surgery Dept has horrible management, if you suck up to them you will go far even if you are below average. If you disagree with their horrible decisions you will pay. O.R educator is a joke, not very knowledgeable. Giving good patient care is not a priority. Benefits shrink every year. Raises are a joke.

""Great co-workers, terrible management""
Former Employee - Registered Nurse 
Doesn't Recommend
Negative Outlook
No opinion of CEO
I worked at Swedish Covenant full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
-Co-workers, they’re like family 
-Proximity to home (many live in surrounded neighborhood, my commute was 1 mile) 
-Parking cheap! 
-Since pay is so low, you are able to negotiate other incentives (maybe only certain people) 
-Lots of evidence based practice initiatives, but easily hindered by “old school” doctors who don’t want to get with the times
Cons
-Low base pay, even worse annual raises
-Unqualified people in management positions. Promoted from within without proper background. Way too much overlap in job descriptions. 
-Management acted very unprofessional (yelling at staff meetings, rolling eyes when asked to do things) 
-Turnover is horrendous. Units mainly staffed by new grads. Can’t attract experienced nurses with pay grade.
Advice to Management
Try and remember what it was like to be a bedside nurse. If you model professionalism, your staff will follow suite.

Advice to Management
Upper Management needs to look at why turn over rate is so high, work on making managers and supervisor accountable for ensuring staff is accurately completing duties and provide appropriate support and training to staff. 

Perform better exit interview and when you find that sever employees quit due to the same reason such as a bad manager they need to really have HR investigate the claims.

Pros
- Non-managerial employees (doctors, nurses, support staff) are likeable, almost across the board. 
- Management is closer to 50/50 -- they're either very good and dedicated, or completely disconnected and out of touch. 
- Good insurance.
Cons
- Low pay, high turnover. 
- Computer systems are archaic, new updates have made things worse. 
- Management does not support standardized care -- special exceptions are made for doctors who don't necessarily follow any kind of medically/scientifically supported guidelines. 
- They are quick to make changes to unit policy without making a clear announcements.

- Stop changing things that are working well, and focus on improving things that need improvement. 
- Create policies that force ""rogue"" doctors to meet certain hospital standards (rounding times, etc), rather than making a ton of unnecessary exceptions. 
- Streamline processes so that there is less room for error or confusion.

If concerns are brought up about patient safety or nurse/patient ratio to management absolutely nothing gets done about it. Resident physicians covering units don't get their butts off...

Advice to Management
Get to the root of the problem about nursing retention issues and stop short staffing the units. Stop hiring people that can barely speak English or speak in their native Filipino language in front of other staff and patients.

Almost all levels of management have become apathetic to both the needs of the patients and employee satisfaction. Raises are scarce, and workloads have become unsafe.

Pros
Community feel; nice employees-- especially the ones caring for patients. There is a lot of heart on the clinician side.
Cons
Unfortunately, it's really gone downhill just the last handful of years. Poor and uninformed leadership is driving out some of the most caring physicians, providers and staff because of poor decision making. Growth, unless you're senior leadership, is dismal and, quite frankly, not based on talent but who you know.
Advice to Management
Don't get too confident. Your clinicians provide great, award-winning care-- yes. But if you focus only on the dollar, it will only be a matter of time before you drive out your best. Listen to your employees and ask why your talent is seeking better opportunities.

Clock in and out and if you work an extra 5 mins you're 'stealing from the company' because it might accumulate. Management act like dictators and are horrible non-leaders.

I did like and admire some of my coworkers, excluding management. In spite of a rocky departure I did learn a lot of valuable information. Pay and benefits were decent.

Cut-throat management. People disappear overnight. This company doesn't honor contracts. Limited ability to work to the full extent of your licensure and education because of their privileging process--I'm talking about procedures. Absolutely no work / life balance. On call every night. If you are a new provider, stay clear of this place. Maybe come back later in your prime, otherwise you will be cut down.

A few of the management team (Directors and VP level) are ""micro-managers"" who are slow to change and seem unwilling to adapt to meet the needs of both the employees and the organization.

Adapt and learn who your employees are and how they need to be managed in order to be successful all across the organization. Using one management style is not always going to net the same result with every employee.

Pros
Challenging but rewarding build and optimization for the Case Management department. Including Social Workers, Utilization Review along with Psychiatric and Rehab services.

Cons
Lack of career opportunities after implementation of new system. Difficult work/life balance due to inflexible deadlines.

Very high functioning health care system with amazing outcomes and patient satisfaction. I was given a lot of opportunity to develop myself and decide what was most important to me in my profession. Lots of amazing mentors and leaders within the organization. Competitive salary and benefits. One of the largest healthcare organizations in the country.

Lots of work as an administrator; work more with less. Healthcare as a whole is a business, so sometimes it is hard to remember as a nurse that business and healthcare are now one in the same as a nurse. Management is a little rough around the edges; productivity is difficult for front line staff to deal with.
Advice to Management
Hard work should be rewarded with a simple thank you and appreciation. Nothing is as appreciated as being recognized as for doing your job well.

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I worked at Advocate Aurora Health full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Very high functioning health care system with amazing outcomes and patient satisfaction. I was given a lot of opportunity to develop myself and decide what was most important to me in my profession. Lots of amazing mentors and leaders within the organization. Competitive salary and benefits. One of the largest healthcare organizations in the country.
Cons
Lots of work as an administrator; work more with less. Healthcare as a whole is a business, so sometimes it is hard to remember as a nurse that business and healthcare are now one in the same as a nurse. Management is a little rough around the edges; productivity is difficult for front line staff to deal with.
Advice to Management
Hard work should be rewarded with a simple thank you and appreciation. Nothing is as appreciated as being recognized as for doing your job well. Senior management is wonderful at recognizing the smaller things, as they are appreciated. Middle management should appreciate that they have staff like that under them.

Cons
The CEO, Mr. Stone, is a bully. His executive management team will not challenge him. He has a negative impact across the hospital. He will not allow the members of his board to be identified on the hospital webpage, likely to make it difficult for disgruntled staff to complain about him. Lots of incompetence in the C-suite.

I have been working at Northwestern Medicine full-time for more than a year
Pros
Great location, new/latest technology, young community of nurses, and many specialties/floors to choose from
Cons
Nurse to patient ratios are not great. 5:1, 6:1 night shift with no techs overnight to help staff and pay is slightly lower than other Chicago hospitals
Advice to Management
Create better nurse to patient ratios and allow techs to work night shifts to help with patient load and tasks. Biggest reason why people leave the floors is because we are overworked and burned out from not having enough support on the floors

Not very many at all. Run far away.
Cons
Overworked, underpaid, you will be floated all the time to other units/floors including psych. If you are a PCT because you love to take care of people, do NOT work here. They will exploit you as much as possible. There are other places where you can make much more. This place is barely paying above minimum wage. You will be treated like total garbage as a PCT/CNA here, talked down to by staff, and put on whatever...

Don’t give people full patient assignments and make them rotate sitting. That means they have 4 hours of their shift to do 8 hours of work. Then float them at all times, and at every possible chance make them feel disposable and very unimportant.

Be prepared to be secretary, house keeping, scheduler, tour guide, data entry even when busy and staying 2-3 hrs late to chart because of those tasks.

Hire lower entry level staff at 1/3 the price hourly to do secretary, housekeeping duties, data entry to keep costs down, not having nurses stay hours late in overtime performing those tasks all day long away from their families.

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at UnityPoint Health full-time for more than a year
Pros
Benefits, extra shift bonus, co-workers, advancement opportunities, hospital setting- so the floor changes, which allows for your workload to continuously shift.
Cons
It’s healthcare so the chances of being appropriately staffed are the exception not the rule. Personally, I feel that the people you work with determine how much it effects your shift. I work with an amazing group of Nurses and CNAs who put in 100 % to get through each night. If the words “that’s not my job” are part of your vocabulary, it’s very likely you are not part of a team or coachable.
Advice to Management
Our service line in particular has started doing staffing each shift then floating between units. So if you were hired to work with children you could end up on the senior behavioral health floor on any given shift- all of the units have found ways around this from penciling in PRNs until after they do staffing for each shift, not counting house floats, or raising acuity in order to keep staff. In the end you end...

Pros

Management doesn’t care, mice and flies in food service areas, work you overtime constantly, never get the time off you request, horrible co-workers, issues with co-workers never get dealt with, HR doesn’t care, unreasonable requests, no one likes their job, constantly hearing complaints, no room for growth or movement within the company.

Get managers in place that actually care about the wellbeing and happiness of their employees, that notice exceptional work, and that discipline poor behavior.

""Behavioral Health""
Current Employee - Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Peoria, IL
Recommends
Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at UnityPoint Health full-time for more than a year
Pros
Benefits, extra shift bonus, co-workers, advancement opportunities, hospital setting- so the floor changes, which allows for your workload to continuously shift.
Cons
It’s healthcare so the chances of being appropriately staffed are the exception not the rule. Personally, I feel that the people you work with determine how much it effects your shift. I work with an amazing group of Nurses and CNAs who put in 100 % to get through each night. If the words “that’s not my job” are part of your vocabulary, it’s very likely you are not part of a team or coachable.
Advice to Management
Our service line in particular has started doing staffing each shift then floating between units. So if you were hired to work with children you could end up on the senior behavioral health floor on any given shift- all of the units have found ways around this from penciling in PRNs until after they do staffing for each shift, not counting house floats, or raising acuity in order to keep staff. In the end you end...

I have been working at Northwestern Medicine full-time for more than a year
Pros
As a software developer, you have opportunities to work on many projects that make you expand your skill set. Really laid back place to work if you are in the IT department. Never work outside of my 9-5.
Cons
Sometimes workload can get overwhelming and you will have to juggle multiple tasks at once.
Advice to Management
Managers do your best to put the hammer down if you notice your employees are being take advantage of or overwhelmed by other departments. Do your best to limit expectations to other stakeholder and business owners. Continue to provide more avenues for growth.

For the good of this hospital, the benefits were okay. You got a yearly bonus, and a gift from the sisters. The health insurance was pretty good. People I worked with were awesome.

You only got one break, 30 minutes. and sometimes you didn't even get that. The higher up people did not care about you or the patients at all, just about making money. I would not work here again.

I have been working at OSF HealthCare
Pros
OSF is a great employer! All the people I work with are wonderful including management. I do see some favoritism.
Cons
My issues are more with the fact that equipment is outdated and there needs to be more security cameras added as well as more staff in diagnostics around the clock.
Advice to Management
The air conditioning throughout the hospital needs to be updated. Every room, hallway, elevator ect. is a different temperature. Heat breeds infection and you would think of all things in a hospital to be taken care of that would be number one. OSF St. Anthony's Health Center in Alton, IL needs a huge overhaul to provide better care for patients and a better environment for their employees.

Managers condescending and not there for the employees. Management wants to make themselves look good in front of the administration from Peoria. One told the employee to push through her chest pain to get her charting done. Within a short time frame the employee ended up in the hospital with respiratory failure. There is more, not supportive of continuing education.

Come down to earth and work with your employees and not against them. Do not be an authoritarian boss but a boss or manager that is Instrumental and Expressive style.

Cons
My issues are more with the fact that equipment is outdated and there needs to be more security cameras added as well as more staff in diagnostics around the clock.
Advice to Management
The air conditioning throughout the hospital needs to be updated. Every room, hallway, elevator ect. is a different temperature. Heat breeds infection and you would think of all things in a hospital to be taken care of that would be number one. OSF St. Anthony's Health Center in Alton, IL needs a huge overhaul to provide better care for patients and a better environment for their employees.

I worked at OSF HealthCare full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
None. I do not have any pros to post about the company. I think management stinks.
Cons
Managers condescending and not there for the employees. Management wants to make themselves look good in front of the administration from Peoria. One told the employee to push through her chest pain to get her charting done. Within a short time frame the employee ended up in the hospital with respiratory failure. There is more, not supportive of continuing education.
Advice to Management
Come down to earth and work with your employees and not against them. Do not be an authoritarian boss but a boss or manager that is Instrumental and Expressive style.

I have been working at OSF HealthCare
Pros
OSF is a great employer! All the people I work with are wonderful including management. I do see some favoritism.
Cons
My issues are more with the fact that equipment is outdated and there needs to be more security cameras added as well as more staff in diagnostics around the clock.
Advice to Management
The air conditioning throughout the hospital needs to be updated. Every room, hallway, elevator ect. is a different temperature. Heat breeds infection and you would think of all things in a hospital to be taken care of that would be number one. OSF St. Anthony's Health Center in Alton, IL needs a huge overhaul to provide better care for patients and a better environment for their employees.

I worked at OSF HealthCare full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
None. I do not have any pros to post about the company. I think management stinks.
Cons
Managers condescending and not there for the employees. Management wants to make themselves look good in front of the administration from Peoria. One told the employee to push through her chest pain to get her charting done. Within a short time frame the employee ended up in the hospital with respiratory failure. There is more, not supportive of continuing education.
Advice to Management
Come down to earth and work with your employees and not against them. Do not be an authoritarian boss but a boss or manager that is Instrumental and Expressive style.

Collaborate with the person in the insurance department who is setting up the codes. So that patient access representatives and the insurance department understand what type of insurance it goes to.

""Saint Joseph in Joliet- food service. Getting tired, lots of overtime, shorted staffed""
Current Employee - Food Service Worker in Joliet, IL
Recommends
Neutral Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at Presence Health full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
Department works as a team. Managers and Director are very hands on with the staff, which we really appreciate. Pay is ok.
Cons
Food Service is so short staffed, it is frustrating. Long hours, no consistent schedule.
Advice to Management
Figure out what they want, productivity numbers or patient satisfaction. Our staff has been reduced, but the Executives still expect us to provide the same level of service in retail areas and expect excellent patient satisfaction scores.

Negative Outlook
I have been working at Hopedale Medical Complex part-time for more than a year
Pros
Job to pay the bills
Cons
Because of the lack of leadership, mis-management, and cheap/financial-based decisions of the CFO and others, Hopedale has become WELL known in the Central Illinois IT community as one of the worst places to work, especially if you're in the IT field. You'll NEVER....EVER...be successful there. The Rossi's NEVER want to spend any money and, unfortunately, in IT, if you want to be successful, or even survive, you have to be able to spend at least some money. If you're considering working there, just ask around.....research how many IT people--managers, consultants, etc)--have worked there. One after the other after the other after the other....for decades. Hopedale churns through IT people like underwear. Hopedale doesn't care about IT. It's a ""necessary evil"" and they don't want to take the time to understand the consequences of their decisions. Their current IT infrastructure and staff is a complete embarrassment and a total mess. Solvable......if someone with the courage and leadership skills to actually make meaningful decisions would be involved. However, with the current management staff, Hopedale is doomed to forever be a place nobody in IT in Central Illinois wants to work at. Just look at the history. Just ask around in the Central Illinois IT community. Just ask an IT recruiter.....they can't hire anyone in there even in this depressed economy because Hopedale management continually makes decisions to cause IT staff to fail....and the IT community knows that. It's a shame too, because there are a lot of really good people there. It's just that none of the good ones are allowed to make decisions.

Pros
The people you work with are great. Many of the staff are wonderful people and take their jobs seriously. The facility does serve an important need in a rural underserved area. The environment isn't overly stressful.
Cons
This facility is run by the Rossi family. The father built it and about 6 of his children run it. The family doesn't value people. They see medical professionals as 'the help' and treat people poorly. This is evidenced by the constant number of positions open and the high turnover rate. The facility is basically run by Mark and Al Rossi. Both have poor people skills and little understanding of how to build a team. There is always a feeling that staff can be replaced. This facility is little more than a desire to keep their father's dream alive and a way to put millions into the pockets of a few Rossi doctors. If you are desperate, this can be a good place to kill time and draw a paycheck while looking for something better. If you want to be treated like a professional, avoid it!

Pros
Benefits, extra shift bonus, co-workers, advancement opportunities, hospital setting- so the floor changes, which allows for your workload to continuously shift.
Cons
It’s healthcare so the chances of being appropriately staffed are the exception not the rule. Personally, I feel that the people you work with determine how much it effects your shift. I work with an amazing group of Nurses and CNAs who put in 100 % to get through each night. If the words “that’s not my job” are part of your vocabulary, it’s very likely you are not part of a team or coachable.
Advice to Management
Our service line in particular has started doing staffing each shift then floating between units. So if you were hired to work with children you could end up on the senior behavioral health floor on any given shift- all of the units have found ways around this from penciling in PRNs until after they do staffing for each shift, not counting house floats, or raising acuity in order to keep staff. In the end you end...

Management doesn’t care, mice and flies in food service areas, work you overtime constantly, never get the time off you request, horrible co-workers, issues with co-workers never get dealt with, HR doesn’t care, unreasonable requests, no one likes their job, constantly hearing complaints, no room for growth or movement within the company.

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at UnityPoint Health full-time for more than a year
Pros
Benefits, extra shift bonus, co-workers, advancement opportunities, hospital setting- so the floor changes, which allows for your workload to continuously shift.
Cons
It’s healthcare so the chances of being appropriately staffed are the exception not the rule. Personally, I feel that the people you work with determine how much it effects your shift. I work with an amazing group of Nurses and CNAs who put in 100 % to get through each night. If the words “that’s not my job” are part of your vocabulary, it’s very likely you are not part of a team or coachable.
Advice to Management
Our service line in particular has started doing staffing each shift then floating between units. So if you were hired to work with children you could end up on the senior behavioral health floor on any given shift- all of the units have found ways around this from penciling in PRNs until after they do staffing for each shift, not counting house floats, or raising acuity in order to keep staff. In the end you end...

Amazing director and coworkers! The team is stout and management listens to us to improve staff and quality of care.

The flexibility and benefits made my employees want to work and give the best care possible!
Cons
Since the Loyola buyout, our PTO is significantly worse than other hospitals in the area. It doesn’t accrue on time off, is used for sick time and low census. Most employees are hourly. Can’t stress enough the poor PTO accrual. Loyola seems outdated - has a benefits system designed for very high turnover and high burnout / worst quality of patient care through burnout.

Pros
Some very kind, caring coworkers. Rewarding work when helping people who want help. Psych department will give you real experience in mental health.
Cons
MacNeal has changed ownership several times in few years. Corporate agenda cutting budgeting, accepting dangerous patients that put employees and other patients in danger, hiring unqualified personnel, difficult hours, limited effective training, very old equipment, other hospital departments are given all psych department income
Advice to Management
To administration- Put patients and employees first, not corporate profits.
Nursing supervisors are overworked and not given enough resources. They are the connection to the direct care employees, listen to them.

Take employee concern a little more seriously. Even if it’s about current managers. Treat employees like employees. Promotions should be given to those whom are actually qualified to take on position and responsibility. Managers shouldn’t tell employees when it’s ok to take days off much less retaliate when days requested interfere with managers personal schedule and not the work office.

Small hospital if you're a new grad. Residents are great to work with. That will be mainly who you deal with. Most not all are pretty cool and good to work with. Techs are iffy most are good but boy do you have the bad ones.

It's way too easy to lose your license here. Most just get 6 months experience and are out. Between the pay, the mean Co workers, and the patient overload you'll be stressed to the max.

Opportunities to aid current staff in creating and growing career paths should not be for clinical staff only. A healthcare facility is the sum total of all its contributors, not just the clinicians.

""Going downhill""
Former Employee - Telemetry Technician in Herrin, IL
Doesn't Recommend
Negative Outlook
Disapproves of CEO
I worked at Southern Illinois Healthcare full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
My coworkers were mostly great.
Cons
Management has changed the culture since the newest management switch. What used to be a family of co-workers has become an everyone out for themselves environment. Where employees once had input now they are told how things should be by people who have never done the job. Maybe in some industries this would work, but in healthcare it is dangerous and scary. I would no longer feel safe being treated at these...

The people you work with are fantastic, talented, caring people. They want to help people. Doing the right thing is not easy sometimes because of management red tape.

HR does not need to know why I my doctor has referred me to a doctor outside the network, or why he feels a specific prescription may work better.
Advice to Management
Review the benefits plan, a patient's privacy should be respected, especially when they are the ones who have your back, and should not include HR

I worked at SwedishAmerican Health System full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Most of the clinical staff are very caring of each other and of their patients, despite the difficult work environment. It is impressive how much the staff accomplishes with their limited resources.
Cons
Admin and upper management are constantly doing things that inhibit good patient care. Communication is only allowed from top down. Department managers, even if they are well-meaning, are trained to manage in an oppressive manner. Many departments turn over their staff as often as once a year, due to poor treatment and despite having few other employment opportunities.
Advice to Management
While risk management should come from the top down, operating decisions should come from the bottom up.

Pros
This company tries to do things the right way. They have programs to try and help their team members to be successful, have long term company goals and work with their leaders to keep people involved.
Cons
As with many large companies, Franciscan Health can get bogged down by bottom line numbers and corporate decision making that doesn't understand the day to day issues that the company is struggling with.
Advice to Management
Continue developing programs that involve low level leadership in helping to define what is needed. Balance the big picture goals with the day to day challenges that your teams are encountering.

I have been working at Franciscan Health part-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Franciscan just opened a new hospital with state of the art technology. The hospital is located immediately off the interstate.
Cons
I have worked for them for 20+ years and I have seen a major decline in their treatment of employees. The hospital is understaffed and management does not care. A thinner workforce means a bigger bonus for the department managers. Meanwhile, employees are performing not only their job, but other jobs as well...recepting, transporting, cleaning. This compromises patient care. No bonuses for employees or raises...

Pros
Genuine commitment to quality patient care.
Cons
Top (regional) management makes decisions that appear to be financially motivated but do not seem well informed as to their ultimate impact on the business, employees and medical staff.

Coworkers and doctors are great to work with
Pay is competitive.
You get paid time off
Rep lunches are super awesome
They keep expanding and opening new offices
Cons
Not enough staff
Patient complaints
Management is hard to get ahold of
They have a tight budget
The doctor will not see patients if they are late, but if they are running late it's ok
Advice to Management
Franciscan needs to hire enough staff to support the amount of work there is - Maybe there would be more satisfaction and less complaints from patients.

I worked at Franciscan Health full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Due to my role, I had a little more freedom than my coworkers. 
This company helped me to understand what waking up everyday and hating your job feels like. It makes you a much more appreciative person.
Cons
There are so many! I worked at one of their Indiana locations...the pay was terrible, employees often had to do multiple jobs, but only received compensation for one and the employee morale was super low. I worked here for almost 4 years and the best day of my life was the day I was finally offered a different position in a different industry. This place can change you for the worst.
Advice to Management
The list could go on forever, but in a nutshell, listen to the employees more and implement the changes that would benefit them and GIVE THEM BETTER PAY!

Some management is very weak -- they don't do much and don't understand the fundamentals of their own departments. I've seen bigotry and racism out in the open which goes against the mission and values of this hospital. Some managers seem to assume everyone voted for Trump and boast loudly about it. Highly inappropriate.
Advice to Management
You need to weed out the managers who do nothing all day long, yet are salaried. They are defrauding the hospital. You need to pay staff much more. The hourly wages for some is less than what staff makes at a Popeye's Chicken, seriously. Don't be cheap about equipment either.

People are wonderful. Large hospital but with a feel of small-town community hospital. Very friendly. Stays with the mission of a Catholic hospital and, as a result, assures that mission is kept by employees and management alike in their care and concern of employees. Management is friendly but not as open as they should be.

Cons
Where do I begin?? Well, opportunity for advancement is completely non-existent. Unless of course the department heads are friends with you (kiss, kiss).

Support changes by increasing staff during massive changes...not by cutting staff at the same time. Don't forget that you need to have satisfied staff in order to have satisfied patients.

Negative Outlook
I worked at Weiss Memorial Hospital full-time
Pros
High pay and nice people
Cons
Staffing ratios are a huge issue, way to many patients per nurse, not safe. PCT's are very lazy. Doctors do not know how to coordinate with each other and it is at the expense of the patient. Very disorganized and frustrating.
Advice to Management
Administration needs to realize how staffing and treatment of nurses is affecting their nurse turn over rate. When more than 6 people quit on a unit at a time, that has to show you something is not right with the structure of this organization.

Negative Outlook
I worked at Rush Oak Park Hospital full-time
Pros
Afforded growth opportunities. Fair-minded in dealings with employees. Felt like a family.
Cons
Being taken over by Rush University. Lots of layoffs, consolidating workforces by keeping the University staff and letting go the Oak Park staff. Losing the fairness aspect as an employer. Losing the family feeling, sense of community, the friendliness.
Advice to Management
What made Rush Oak Park Hospital was the community feel of it. Getting absorbed by the big University hospital system, it is losing what drew people to it. No one wants to feel like a number, but now the staff AND the patients do. With Patient Satisfaction being tied to reimbursement rates, focusing on boosting morale is what needs to be done to get those scores up.

Pros
The support staff are very good at what they do and are the only reason that this hospital remains open to this day.
Cons
Rush University is sucking the life blood out of this hospital. The worst thing that happened is having the administrative and medical management from Rush.
Little to no vision for growth strategies in this market place.
The so called medical leadership has policies that stifle any insights or comments from independent physicians

I have been working at OSF HealthCare full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Overall, I feel the organization tries to do the right thing. The cultures and values are positive. I have heard of several people leaving the organization only to return a year or two later because the grass was definitely not greener on the other side.
Cons
Staff retention is an issue. Units are always short staffed. While working conditions are pretty good, there is nothing really keeping staff there, unfortunately. Instead of focusing on staff retention, the organization seems to focus more on hiring new staff... which seems counterintuitive and way more costly.
Advice to Management
Get rid of troublesome mission partners quicker. Instead, they keep problematic (lazy, rude, unmotivated) mission partners around for years and then it becomes a real nightmare to let them go. I feel like management hates doing all the paperwork to let someone go, so instead they turn a blind eye and pretend they are listening and concerned but in actuality don't do much to rid bad employees.

Advice to Management
Be more proactive in regards to employee concerns about favoritism and poor behavior where they don’t want to let someone go or reprimand because they feel bad for them or relative or think they are cute. Mid level providers often abused with hours due to poorly handled work schedules as ‘they want to approve all vacation’ to keep everyone happy and ‘we’ll just have to make it work.’

No respect for Nurses. Not enough staff, call is atrocious with 5-6 12hr shifts of call in 6 week period. Supplies are always short, taking from other rooms to get what you need. Be prepared to be secretary, house keeping, scheduler, tour guide, data entry even when busy and staying 2-3 hrs late to chart because of those tasks.

Hire lower entry level staff at 1/3 the price hourly to do secretary, housekeeping duties, data entry to keep costs down, not having nurses stay hours late in overtime performing those tasks all day long away from their families.

Right now everything is still a little crazy but I hope soon itll get better.

It is difficult to move up in the organization without being a nurse, although there are several non-clinical areas in which to prosper. You’re just limited without the RN status. Also, nurses have opportunity for promotion in non-clinical areas, which makes it even more difficult for someone to advance if you’re not a nurse.

This organization tends to hire for long term employees. Many people working at OSF have been here for 20 or 30 years. So this is definitely a career destination.

The salary during promotions only increases 10% to 15% even if you have a big jump in responsibility. However, with that being said, the work life balance at OSF is very good. You only need to work 40 hours a week and no one will think less of you for doing so.

I have been working at OSF HealthCare full-time
Pros
Its a fast paced level 1 trauma center, so there is unlimited potential for learning. There is a College of Nursing associated with this facility which allows for discounted tuition (with a commitment period). I really do love my job!
Cons
The (what appears to be nationwide) issue of short staffing. however, along with this they have taken away incentives for nurses to work overtime to fill these holes which has led to some very dissatisfied employees.
Advice to Management
Pay more attention to your employees and their concerns. At least appear you care about your employees who really do sacrifice to make the hospital run.

The staff I worked with were super, I worked with the best doctor I could imagine and the best APN that is out there. I worked with some of the best nurses and MOA's that you would ever come into contact with. All of them were hard workers and love what they do, they care about the patients and they came first.
Cons
The management are a different aspect. They are there only for themselves and will leave you out to dry. They are not honest people and most do not know how to do their jobs, they are only there because they are robotically engineered to do as they are told, they go through the motions in front of their managers to make themselves look good, they care for no one else.
Advice to Management
Listen to your employees, they are the reason you are there. Without them, you are nothing. You can easily be replaced with someone who actually knows what their job is.

Management did not care about anyone but themselves. The nurses complained often about their driving schedule and would get mad at the scheduler for putting them too far out. The nurses alone made the job quite stressful and having manager who didn't seem to be a good manager didn't help.

Pros
The benefits were excellent despite raising the cost of healthcare for employees yearly. The mission itself is excellent and should be followed as the Sisters direct.
Cons
Human Resources Directors and Managers do not work for the employees but instead chooses to work against them. Positive Discipline only applies to some and not all levels and ""rank"" of staff members.
Advice to Management
If you are going to use a disciplinary standard, use it consistently. Do not give an annual evaluation that is excellent in October and fire the same employee in December with no warning, write up or opportunity for an ""action plan"". Very poor ethics in some divisions and departments, so take a long look in the mirror OSF SFMC Administration. Luckily one of the worst (members of Admin) moved to Florida.

Cons
small hospital close knit, some positionsay have very flexible scheduleschedule. Easy to move around and get hired for different positions once you've worked there for a year.
Advice to Management
Be more considerate of staff that works hard for you.

There honestly are not many pros. The only two pros are the awesome teamwork and the opportunity for a great learning experience. This hospital has a lot of high acuity (very sick) patients which presents the opportunity to practice and learn a lot of critical care nursing skills.
Cons
Many cons..I will keep it short and just list a few: 
- Very short staffed
- No raise, no holiday bonus
- Unclean
- Limited resources
- Unsafe neighborhood
- Limited parking 
- Employee retention very low
Advice to Management
Focus on your employees and what it takes to retain them. They should definitely look at providing incentives to help people stay.

Pros
This is a 24/7 position so there are lots of hours to fill. No face to face contact with public. Downtime between calls is nice. Nice co-workers and atmosphere. Get to help people without being a medical professional.
Cons
Answering service to a couple hundred doctor's offices also - doctors can be very demanding. Must respond efficiently and correctly to a range of emergency codes. Not much room for advancement.
Advice to Management
Don't get too big and unwieldy. Now that hospitals have merged, some of the changes make for a better, more professional environment for patients, but don't let the institution get in the way of employees.

Positive Outlook
No opinion of CEO
I worked at Northwestern Medicine full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
The benefits are competitive to other medical groups in the area, good life-work balance, company with amazing reputation. The company as a whole cares about its employees.
Cons
Benefits are awesome, pay is not. There is a huge gap in pay depending on what office you work in, favoritism, how desperate they are to keep you, etc. At my location there was a huge turn over rate. Terrible management, it was absolutely awful. Low morale and no one did anything about it. Concerns and issues were dismissed and never addressed.
Advice to Management
Get it together. For the team. Be supportive, listen and actually be proactive about concerns brought to the table. Appreciate hard workers, praise loyal employees.

Pros
The staff and coworkers are informative and helpful. You feel like you help people everyday and it's a fast paced environment. The job is also active, you work on your feet most if not all day.
Cons
The standards set at the company are extremely rigid and they expect too much with too little training. They did not properly prepare me and inform me of what is expected of me
Advice to Management
I would say to give more chances for remediation and for error. It is impossible to be perfect and being my first opportunity as a nursing assistant they should have done a better job coaching and preparing their workers.

Appreciate your long term employees. They are dedicated and well qualified. Maybe then you will get a better payer mix. Stop the descrimination.

Figure out where true cost cutting makes sense. Wiping out a program like the midwives which were 1.5 Million in the black in real dollars was not a wise decision. Apparently firing the CFO was in order. What has happened is you have instilled a culture of uncertainty, no confidence and fear.

I worked at Perry Memorial Hospital full-time for more than a year
Pros
Friendly staff, very helpful and courteous employees throughout the hospital. Reasonably modern physical facility. Mostly excellent benefits, but continuing education is a notable omission. Very easy going overall, but perhaps too much so.
Cons
A strong culture of complacency/non-growth. No opportunities for promotion except via death/firing, and the senior management is young enough that they can all stay in place at least another 5 to 10 years. The management structure is a very rigid hierarchy with thick-walled, secretive silos within every department. The two primary management philosophies are ""We've always done it this way"" and ""Not my idea.""
Advice to Management
Break down the silos. Cut the number of regular managers' meetings by 2/3s and develop ad hoc, interdepartmental teams to focus on specific tasks. Set goals, advertise them broadly, and seek input from the line employees. Eliminate all the trite ""morale boosters"" and offer employees the chance to excel (or fail). Work with the physicians proactively rather than waiting for complaints and then punishing staff.

Cons

Advice to Management
-PCTs do an insane amount of work, especially in high volume, high acuity units in the hospital. They should be paid at least five dollars more base salary an hour.

Pros
Professional people, good use of technology to enhance job responsibilities.
Cons
This company is taking on waaaaaayyyy too much in terms of adding hundreds of immediate care centers and are not taking the time to educate and take care of their current employees. The employees are in turn getting frustrated and leaving. The people in my department were not nice at all, and in fact took an active role in lots of back-stabbing behavior. It was extremely petty and not a good place to work.

Floors have cliques and the gossip mill is encouraged by management. Bullying is common.
Very short-staffed. Could be prevented by intelligent and pro-active management or better treatment of current managers.

Incentive pay not paid when charge RN, preceptor, bonus shift etc.
Advice to Management
Anticipate staff shortages and hire before staff leave.
Squash the rumor mill situation instead of encouraging infighting and lying.
Treat your employees with at least the amount of respect due a fellow human-being.
Bullying should not be tolerated.
Just because BJC does something one way does not mean it works best for Memorial.

Pay more attention to the employees that are doing a great job. Make people want to stay with the company by giving them the hours and not making someone feel like they are just a body needed on the floor.

I worked at Advocate South Suburban Hospital full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
The benefits are good but costly. Many options to transfer to if you wish to do so. There are not too many pros, sorry.
Cons
Favoritism is abundant. Very unprofessional environment. People are in positions who were not educationally qualified. I was there 20+ years and it was very disheartening to see the department going down the tubes. We would work so hard to meet goals throughout the year and be thrown a turkey at Christmas. There was never any appreciation.
Advice to Management
Learn to appreciate your employees. Also clean up your office area employees a little...they are the first ones every one sees and hears and they do not make a good impression. Keep the standards for management positions as it makes you look foolish to lower the requirements to put your ""picks"" in the positions.

•Organization is too into outward appearances and does not care about its employees.

Disapproves of CEO
I have been working at Carle Foundation Hospital full-time for more than a year
Pros
Cafeteria is open 24/7. Nursing staff works 12 hour shifts which gives more days away from the facility which is needed to recharge.
Cons
I am actively seeking other employment. Carle has a God complex culture which takes patients out of their own decision making. Carle would rather force somebody to do things their way by any means necessary, including chemical and physical restraint rather then allow them direction of their medical decisions.
Advice to Management
Wise up you are not above the law and do not get to make decisions against what a patient wants. People matter more than the bottom line.

Advice to Management
LDI is a great initiative and helps the supervisors to more effectively manage. However, it is the 3's that actually run the teams and they are all using their own techniques rather than one unified approach that is taught in LDI. Expand LDI to the 3's so every team is run the same way and would cause less confusion between employees.

Management allows an atmosphere of bickering, tattling, and retaliation. It is unfortunate because if you go to your supervisor with a problem, they either ignore you or dismiss you all together. They foster an environment that is hostile and then retaliate against you, if you make a complaint with HR. Managers direct employees to remove items from official documents because it might make the hospital look bad.

Pros
Upper management does try to set a high standard and it feels like they try to live up to it themselves. Very competitive pay for my discipline. Good benefits--seen better. Opportunity for continued training and advancement. Lots of communicatin both directions. Pay increases, rewards for meeting company goals, the take employee performance reviews seriously. Has the resources to be a steady place of employment
Cons
It's corporate and a bit uptight and old fashioned. Change is constant. Big. There is a lot to know about the place and most of the time you only have a narrow view of the organization. Hard to get hired in some areas--apply online and you may never ever hear from HR. Simple things seem to be complicated.

There is little to no support of the staff by the middle or upper management. Units frequently work extremely short staffed placing patients at risk & when concerns are voiced they fall on deaf ears.

Management does not listen to staff or doctors. Over all, leadership is uncommunicative except to dictate orders. Staff are threatened with discipline for voicing their opinions and sometimes just to make sure you know who is the boss.

Provide a transparent structure for pay scale increases and raises based on employee performance, time worked, and previous job experience so that employees can better understand why they are being paid what they are.

Positive Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at UnityPoint Health full-time for more than 10 years
Pros
Great coworkers, good manager, good benefits (although better in past years).
Cons
Upper management and administration is out of touch with the reality of bedside healthcare leaving some units understaffed frequently. FOCUS values are not consistently enforced for all, especially in the case of physicians who are allowed to verbally abuse nurses without repercussion. Lower pay than the competition across the river, not as nice of a facility either.
Advice to Management
Actually listen to your employees-if you’re going to do “executive rounds” act on the things people bring to your attention. Do not allow physicians to get away with poor behavior any longer. Uphold them to the same standards of behavior everyone else is expected to follow.

I have worked there 2 years in two different departments. Most of the time there is at least one or two co-workers that are amazing.

Management is awful. They have no idea what they are doing and half the time make up rules that aren't written anywhere. They lie about job descriptions and opportunities affored to employees that stay. All around a horrible company to work for.

I have worked in 3 different large health systems in the area, and can say this place is wonderful to work at. The people make the organization, and the culture is very positive and administrator/leadership is supportive. I would reccomend anyone wanting to learn and get pulled into different things to check this place out. Definitely opportunities here to grow and my experience has been very positive.
Cons
Technology is definitely lacking here. Outdated Microsoft Outlook platform, but clinical technology is adequate. More/updated tech is needed on the business side.
Advice to Management
Keep on doing what you are doing. Just make sure to keep fighting for employee benefits to not go up in cost. So far so good, but usually a concern area for all organizations is the benefits tend to creep up year over year.

Pros
More involved with situations going on and have actual input. Training is more extensive then most security jobs. Co workers are for the majority very nice and happy.
Cons
Real world situations are not taken serious as far as safety. Medically such as disasters they are, but not for someone who is looking to do harm with a weapon. So I guess you could say that when it comes to real issues it's hard to get full attention when it's not medical.
Advice to Management
The world at the moment is a very dangerous and unpredictable. You can't say you care about peoples safety and well being and not have armed security. Signs do not stop criminals or upset patients or their family members or even disgruntled employees. It's never IF something is going to happen. It's WHEN is it going to happen and will you be prepared?

Not a bad place to work. Managing styles vary by units. It's relatively easy to move to another department. There is often opportunity to pick up hours even on other floors.
Cons
I took a pay cut coming here. Overall they pay less than most other hospitals. Not sure why. The Dr.s here leave much to be desired. Most are still not placing their own orders in even though they are supposed to. Good luck getting call backs from them too. Too many of the MD's are just plain rude and try to avoid staff. The computer system is a cheap version of Cerner. It's not efficient. Maybe that's why the drs...

Cons

Pros
Strong leadership. Lots of positive changes. Services are beginning to align with the needs of the community. Family-oriented environment. People are super kind.
Cons
There are a few key leaders who should not be in their positions. their lack of understanding about health care and inability to change with the new direction of leadership is a bit disheartening. It's preventing the hospital from moving forward. This is a shame because new leadership is progressive and exciting. Pay could be a lot more competitive as well.

Right now everything is still a little crazy but I hope soon itll get better. We are short staffed 75% of the time which makes it very hard on the staff that actually cares about their job. oh yeah OSF switched our insurance from BCBS to Humana, which sucks!

No opinion of CEO
I have been working at OSF HealthCare full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Higher pay then most jobs in Danville, IL but I work night shift so I have differential pay. Most of my coworkers are easy to get along with.
Cons
Our hospital was bought by OSF in Feb 2018. We got 1-5 days of training for epic, which wasnt OSF's fault but the previous owners. Right now everything is still a little crazy but I hope soon itll get better. We are short staffed 75% of the time which makes it very hard on the staff that actually cares about their job. oh yeah OSF switched our insurance from BCBS to Humana, which sucks!

Cons
Very weak management team.
The Galesburg branch of this large organization has become overcome with problems mostly due to lack of oversight. It is a small operation with family members and friend in management positions not always carrying on the mission statement.

Advice to Management
The leadership at OSF, specifically the CEO in charge of all of the hospitals needs to take a close look at the well established management team and realize that maybe separating the family and other members would be the best for the group. There is a corrupt managerial behavior tarnishing the OSF name at that location.

You will see some medically complex patients and learn a lot. Management is fairly lax. Doctors are good to work with, for the most part.
Cons
Pay is low, benefits are poor, facility is lacking in high quality care, and bad habits to be picked up are abundant. People get comfortable and never leave, hence no real change or improvement.
Advice to Management
Treat your nurses like the professionals they are. Stop grouping everyone- especially your newer staff- with the complacent staff you've had in place for 25+ years. You're losing excellent nurses because they're talked down to by administration and physicians as being non-critical thinking, and incompetent. Once a 3west director even told her staff ""Your jobs aren't that hard, so just do them"" during a meeting. Not...

I worked at Saint Anthony Hospital full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Strong team of co-workers, tuition reimbursement is available, and great summer employee picnic/outing. Competitive pay, 2% annual raise, good benefits. Free employee parking.
Cons
Staffing is very inconsistent; frequently low-censused, high acuity, and short staffing. Staff gets burned out from short staffing with high acuity patients, which leads to many employee call offs ad well. I would still be working there if it wasn't for scheduling issues.
Advice to Management
Be more consistent with staffing. Being short staffing creates stress and a negative work for staff, in addition to puts quality patient care at risk as well as patient safety.

Cons
The merge created a lot of undue stress and a lot of things were not discussed prior. A lot of Janesville management and directors have bossy attitudes its their Janesville way or else. They don’t listen to work flow ideas from RMH partners they always take over and their ideas are always used. They need to know how to communicate with staff. Director will walk right past her staff and act as if they don’t exist....

How can you run a hospital when you're not here? Be visible to staff, hire the best candidate, not your Best Friend, go easy on the nepotism.

Horrible company. Benefits are atrocious. But the worst is management. They are too concerned with patting themselves on the back to care about what the employees actually think.

In some ways, very supportive atmosphere. General atmosphere is very friendly and much of upper management seems very dedicated to the hospital and its mission.
Cons
Starting salary for nurses somewhat below average. Some floors have a very nasty, almost toxic, culture with little cliques and a lot backbiting (even within cliques.) Many of the nurses seem bitter and burned out.
Advice to Management
Keep doing what you're doing. Rome wasn't built in a day and the improvements made so far are paying off.

I have been working at OSF HealthCare full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
OSF provides great opportunities for advancement. They put extensive time and energy into training their employees to move into advanced roles outside their comfort zones. The organization is supportive of a patient first culture. They also focus on continuous quality improvement. Employee salaries and benefits are competetive.
Cons
OSF requires accountability from all employees. Although this is not a ""con"" in my opinion, if you are looking to coast along, this may not be the organization for you. OSF expects all employees to understand how they play a part in achieving optimal patient outcomes and all employees are expected to uphold those standards.

I have been working at OSF HealthCare full-time for more than 8 years
Pros
OSF provides great opportunities for advancement. They put extensive time and energy into training their employees to move into advanced roles outside their comfort zones. The organization is supportive of a patient first culture. They also focus on continuous quality improvement. Employee salaries and benefits are competetive.
Cons
OSF requires accountability from all employees. Although this is not a ""con"" in my opinion, if you are looking to coast along, this may not be the organization for you. OSF expects all employees to understand how they play a part in achieving optimal patient outcomes and all employees are expected to uphold those standards.

Pros
Fun to work at and the benefits are decent.
Cons
The pay for PSR isn't the greatest. The work is not hard but it's a lot and definitely a position that gets under paid!

I have been working at Kirby Medical Center full-time for more than 5 years
Pros
Small town hospital that is moving forward by leaps and bounds. The CEO and all of the administrative staff has done a tremendous job leading Kirby to the level of success it's at. Great work/life balance, everyone knows your name, you're not just a face in a crowd, the administrative support that is given is unmatched.
Cons
While an open door policy is amazing, it can sometimes lead to staff believing they should have say over a department they may not work in.

""Overall, KMG is a positive environment with nice perks and a flexible atmosphere.""

Neutral Outlook
Approves of CEO
I have been working at Kirby Medical Center for more than 3 years
Pros
Small, family feel. Mostly supportive administration. Great flexibility. Nice benefits. Overall, this is great place to work. As a community outsider, it is refreshing to see how you should be treated within an organization you didn't ""grow up with.""
Cons
Not much room for growth due to size. Can somewhat be small minded and small town. Again, the family atmosphere can be nice but it can also be a disadvantage if you're overlooked for someone who has been with the company for longer but may be less qualified.
Advice to Management
When input is asked for, make sure you're listening. It can be frustrating to give input over and over but it is never taken seriously or acknowledged.

Negative Outlook
I worked at Kirby Medical Center full-time for more than a year
Pros
Great benefits....honestly other than small work environment...nothing
Cons
Management is very fake with cookie cutter personality types. Watch what you say and to whom around there...the management will use your confidential information and share it with staff, then act like they did nothing wrong. Also watch what you say in your yearly evaluation especially if it is negative...There is nothing but drama at this hospital. So if you agree to disagree, don't count on staying there long....

This is not a place I would work at ever again. If you are going to preach confidentiality, maybe you should learn to value your employees' as well

""Kirby has been a great place to work, but the administration has turned from friend of the little guys to a bully.""
Current Employee - Anonymous Employee 
Positive Outlook
I have been working at Kirby Medical Center full-time for more than 3 years
Pros
Small hospital gives you a lot of face time with patients, and employees. A brand new facility offers a cozy atmosphere. There is a great deal of employee and community pride.
Cons
The communication of management between departments and to employees has been nightmarish. Be ready to learn everything on the fly, and then relearn it tomorrow. Because its a small-town community, so is the hospital. Expect nepotism and if you're not 'in' don't expect advancement of any kind.
Advice to Management
Start using a system that tracks performance of management and employees that has tangible rewards for exceeding expectations and real consequences for recurrent incompetence.
