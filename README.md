# betterchuRN

### Insight Data Science Fellow Project - Boston 2020A

This project uses a machine learning approach to predict turnover of registered nurses (RN) at 184 Illinois hospitals. Combining data sources on hospital and staffing metrics, patient survey responses, and employee sentiments, users can get predicted turnover rates and see how changes in employee sentiments may change estimated turnover. The project is deployed as a streamlit [web app](https://betterchurn.herokuapp.com/) via heroku.
