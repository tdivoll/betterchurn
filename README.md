### Insight Data Science Fellow Project - Boston 2020A

This project uses a machine learning approach to predict turnover of registered nurses (RN) at 184 Illinois hospitals. The national average of nurse churn is 17%, and it costs an estimated $40-85k and 3 months time to replace a nurse. Combining data sources on hospital and staffing metrics, patient survey responses, and employee sentiments, users can get predicted turnover rates and see how changes in employee sentiments may change estimated turnover. With such insights, hospital administrators can gain insights on focal areas on turnover is an issue. The project is deployed as a streamlit [website application](https://betterchurn.herokuapp.com/) via heroku.
